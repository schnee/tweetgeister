We thought it was a cheaper option compared to the expensive resorts in Montego Bay. However, we discovered that we were completely cheated off our money.   1. The Owner demands entire payment plus security deposit in advance via paypal so you cannot do anything after you see the property.  2. Firstly, the property was no where close to our expectations. Here are some of the things we saw:   a. The Internet at the property didn’t work at all. We couldn’t look up any local sites to see and hugely impacted our trip   b. Although the description says fenced, half fence of the property has been torn down, and was a safety concern.    c. Although promised in the description, there was no phone in the house   d. Neighbors Dogs bark all night   e. The bulbs at the property were missing and different color   f. The kitchen taps made an awful loud sound   g. The walls were plastered and not painted.   h. The flush has stopped working 4 times. We have to tighten the valves.   3. Thirdly, as we brought these issues to the notice of the owner, he did not do anything about it, but asked more questions (like how many bulbs are missing, Do you know how to troubleshoot a connection?) and wasted time so we could not move to another property  4. The entire property is invested with ants. We also had frogs and lizards show up. The caretaker could not do anything to repair the internet connection or get rid of the pests  5. The worst part came on Christmas day, when the toilet started getting clogged and overflowing. We had to get a plunger plunge it on Christmas day!!   6. Finally, we somehow sucked it up and stayed outside almost all the time. We came back and requested the owner many times over phone calls to return our $ security deposit. Guess what, he threatened us to write good reviews of  his property before he would return the deposit. To make it worse, he made us wait 30 days and then did not return the deposit. He accused us of making unauthorized plumbing changes and using too much water and electricity and hence did not return our money.","unitReviewedId":1432687}},"1":{"9324":{"headline":"Pictures don't tell the real story!","id":9324,"rating":1,"review":"Rented this house based on the pictures and commentary of the boat for rent, outdoor kitchen, heated pool and spa.

The description of the property, as well as the pictures, were exaggerated.  For example, the \"gourmet kitchen\", consisted of one wine glass, a broken oven broiler, warped cookware, dishes that had been put away dirty, mice droppings in a drawer and garbage.  The owner of the property did send over three addtional wine glasses. When we entered the property, there was dirt on the floors, dust everywhere, dirty windows, other peoples used products and a broken toilet in the second bathroom.  The owner did come to the property to fix the toilet.  We also inquired about the solar heat for the pool.  We were assured that it was working and doing fine.   Having knowledge of the solar heat system, when we turned the valve on, it leaked in multiple places therefore unable to heat the pool.  The nextdoor caretaker was surprised when we notified her of the problem since she knew it did not work.  We notified the owner and was given false hope that it would be fixed.  No one ever showed to fix it.  The site also promotes that it is \"secure\".  There is a gate at the driveway, ADT signs around the property but no sensors on the windows, doors or a central alarm system.  The landscaping consists of a broken light system along with overgrown weeds and foilage.  The outdoor furniture was not as depicted in the pictures-full of mildew, dirty, broken and cushions missing.  There was a promise of kayaks, which there were two, but no instructions on how to get them in the water since there was no dock available.  Also, fishing equipment was non exsistent despite the description on the site.  Beach access was approximately 1.3 miles away which is somewhat far when carrying beach items for the day.  The walk was on main roads.  Siesta Key village was also a mile away.  We were extremely disappointed with this property.  We only hope the owners other properties are as described.

We were awaken every morning at 9am to construction and we even went an entire day without water (10a-9p to be exact).  Don't expect to cook a great meal in the overly used cookware.  The apartment manager Marjorie didn't respond in a timely matter to my complaints as she went out of town upon my arrival (don't look to her for things to do either).  The tv doesn't have local channels, therefore, we were unable to see the weather which would have forewarned and prepared us for the 5.1 earthquake we experienced.

The villa is quite close to the one next door, on a development where about half of the villas are finished.   I don't think you would be bothered by construction work as most of the unfinished ones seem abandoned but the development as a whole does look a bit unloved as a result.     The villa is pleasant inside, as advertised, and the terrace at the front is a good place for meals.   The pool is good but close to the neighbouring property.  The car hire and taxi pick up works very well and we had a telephone call during our stay from the house manager to see if everything was OK.      If you are a big group looking for a base this might be for you, but be aware that you will end up paying a lot more than the advertised price as there is a \"deposit\" of 50% extra that is used to pay water and electricity charges and these will take up most of what you have paid.

On arrival  at the villa we were a little daunted  that we drove down this very rough track to the villa's and that the gates didn't lock being 4 ladies on there own !! and considering a couple of little shantys outside  we were a bit concerned about leaving all our stuff with access after the first couple of days we didn't worry any more as Caroline has security on the villa's. We were also given  some little extra's to compensate for the building work happening across the path.  The only issue that we found that couldn't be resolved was that WE assumed that the shared bathroom would be easily accessible by both bedrooms when in fact the bathroom is in one of the bedrooms. There is a powder room down stairs which one of the ladies used during the night. Overall the staff were wonderful breakfast was always on time. We aslo had a few meal at the villa which were great giving Katuk the money for groceries for what we wanted and 10,000 rupiah about $1 for fuel was a great bargain. Our driver NED was available 8 hrs a day free  petrol included after the 8 hrs we paid  approx $5 an hr. There is a number of good restaurants  about 250m away on the beach the local hotel has great food really cold beer and a great place to visit on Sunday afternoons with a live band. A new beauty shop has just opened  behind the hotel and while a little bit more expensive are handy and easy to get to.

Could not be opened/closed.  Bedroom blinds fell down from window in middle of night. Owner did not return call for 2 days after. We had to contact maintenance man to fix. Shelves in closet had fallen down and couldn’t be used so no place to hang clothes.  Towels very old almost threadbare. Bed spreads had not been laundered. Kitchen stove very dirty, burners crooked,so they were hard to use. Mildew around kitchen faucet. Outside furniture very old and dirty.  Balcony floor also very dirty when we arrived. TV’s in bedrooms did not work properly. Owner suggested we contact cable company or just unplug cable.  We had paid in advance or we would have left. Owner would not refund of course.  Location was outstanding. View excellent and BUILDING was nicely remodeled, but this unit was extremely disappointing and totally unmaintained. We spent a lot of time cleaning and repairing ourselves. The vacuum cleaners were so dirty they were unusable until we cleaned them ourselves.  In summary, the description painted a wonderful picutre that simply wasn't accurate. His response was that people just have different levels of expectation. Other residents informed us that past tenets had similar experience to ours. Some had simply left even without a refund. Feel free to contact tomj675@aol.com if you have questions.

Despite the double glazing and being two floors up there were 'loud' people walking past in the street at all times of the night and plenty of early morning 'drilling' from a neighbouring building! A number of good restaurants available very locally.  Found walking and using the metro the most practical way to get around.  There are pickpockets - we witnessed police round up five at one station but awareness and common sense make this a pretty safe place.  We found the people very friendly and helpful. Tibidabo, Montjuic, the beach and port and Sagrada Familia all highlights.  The latter especially.  No long queue during siesta time! Thought the Barcelona Card and Sightseeing Bus poor value for money - did not use.  Had one trip out of the city to Monserrat.  Easy journey by train.

Being picked up at the airport by Mr Enzo was greatly appreciated. However meeting the owner at the apartment on arrival (after a 30 hour flight) might have been a nice touch, but we were inconvenienced by a tradesman who was also present who was installing a curtain rail and curtains into one of the bedrooms. Also on arrival, there was no hot water (as it had just been switched on and it takes minimum 2 hours to heat). Therefore on arrival, we could no have a hot shower because there was not hot water, and we couldn't relax because there was a tradesman present. The apartment photos are somewhat deceptive. The kitchen/meals is very tiny and there is no living area except a tiny loft with very dangerous stairs (that are not appropriate for young children) and a very low ceiling (that is not practical for men/women that are 6 feet tall). The complicated setup of the TV/playstation unit which is located in the loft, did not work for the 4 days of our stay - despite unsuccessful attempts to fix by owners staff. We lived without hot water for 24 hours because the powerpoint switch in the bathroom also controls the hot water unit - a very confusing setup. Although the apartment looks clean to the naked eye, in reality it wasn't. A new or clean sponge would have been appreciated and the floor could use a more frequent mop. Unfortunately we found the owner unreceptive to our issues and certainly didn't take ownership of the issues. The owner was more interested in passing blame as opposed to fixing the problems. Overall - Rome the destination is great, but when we return next time, we will look for alternative accommodation which is hopefully cleaner and where all amenities are in good working order and easy to use - like the apartments we stayed-in subsequently in Florence and Cinque Terre.","unitReviewedId":1448919},"3738":{"headline":"Very nice property, great location for everyone.","id":3738,"rating":4,"review":"We recently returned from a month long stay at this property.

The attic-level living room is unusable for anyone over 5' tall, and I'd hate to see what it is like up there in the hotter summer months. The advertised \"fast wifi\" turned out not to work at all, which made navigating our trip quite a bit harder. The bedroom with the king bed overlooks an extremely busy little thoroughfare, which yields an astounding amount of noise well into the night. If you do decide to stay at this place, be sure to bring industrial-grade ear plugs, as sleeping is a real challenge. The fact that the mattress in that room is essentially a fabric-covered board doesn't help matters. Also, if you aren't big on stairs, stay away, as the front door is up three steep flights, and then there are two more sets of stairs within the little apartment. All in all, a big disappointment.

You can tell when you're in it that it's really pretty old, even though all of the pics here look modern.   We also got charged  for an old bike with a lock that was unreadable...we couldn't unlock it one night and it was taken away. The owner charged us more than brand new bikes were selling for in town. This bike was at least 5 years old. The owner said \"don't worry about it\" when I called and told her but then charged me full price anyway. Not really sure why she would say \"don't worry about it\" and then charge me. Obviously what I would be worried about is being charged for the bike....If you say don't worry about it why would I expect to be charged. Anyway, that was frustrating.

We were very interested in this property to house some of our wedding party, and wanted to possibly rent the sister house for the rest of the crew.  To my amazement, we were DENIED any chance of looking @ this property or the sister property.  The booking assistant beat around the bush for about a month, stating that they \"normally don't show the house\"---what??  I finally got him to agree to give a \"really quick\" showing when we arrived in L.A.  However, he did not respond to my phone calls once we were there.  My fiance then called to see what the deal was.  He was told that the house is in an \"upscale neighborhood\" and that they \"don't allow just anyone to stay there.\"  WOW.  What?  What I read into this is that they think that we are some sort of scum of the earth, and that we would not respect their property or the neighborhood.  We were also told that it is \"not a partying-type place.\"  Again--WOW.  Maybe they didn't realize that the group of us is in our 40's,50's, and 60's and that there are several millionaires that will be staying.  Too bad, they just lost out on renting both the properties for 10 days.  We went with one of the neighbors' villas.  On an end note, I must say that I was VERY offended.

The backyard with the pool (mineral, not chlorine), hot tub, table, chairs, loungers, sun umbrellas and hammocks was the most restful place we have ever been. Just lying in the hammocks made you feel like you were relaxing at the finest spa. The house itself, was very comfortable and really did seem larger than it looked. There were plenty of towels, sheets, pillows, dishes, glasses, etc.. I can't say enough about Nick. ANYTIME there was an issue, he was immediately reachable on his cell phone, and was willing to do whatever it took to make it right. The issues were minor, and quickly resolved. He was even kind enough to leave us some Ralph cards so that we could receive the discounts on our groceries. The neighbourhood is perfect. Very close, easy walk to downtown. Also, very good value for 6 people, who otherwise would have had to stay in 3 hotel rooms. The only minor flaw, in the otherwise perfect scenario, was the housekeeping was not perfect. My husband and I did spend about 1/2 an hour cleaning the outside lawn furniture and dusting the inside, and then it was perfect.( But, I am very particular) But, to Nick's credit, all the cleaning supplies were there, even including laundry supplies, some kitchen staples, and some really fun floatation devices for the pool. We had some relatives staying close by, and they came over with the grand-children, and it was so great to be able to position the big sun umbrellas that were in the backyard to cast shade on the pool, so that the little ones could play in the pool.

We rented property at 6221  four peaks place from Bruce and Brad.   When we walked in the first thing was the  horrible stained carpet.   There was burnt crude on the stove top.   The kitchen chairs were white stained black.  The refrigerator was stained with black stains and the ice maker didn’t work.   The blinds in all the rooms are falling down and one bedroom the blinds actually had a hole in them.   The bathroom stools are crude coded and the fixtures in the bathrooms are crude coded around the edges.  The woodwork is filthy.   Painted white and covered with dirt.    When we arrived there was a smell in the kitchen and I found a slimy pan that was used to collect water from the leak in the sink.    Also the kitchen sink was so stain and dirty it was disgusting.  The pans were grease covered.   There was broken glass in the dishwasher.  There was no garage door opener and the 2 small TV’s are box style and the remote didn’t work.     Pool was nice after several visits from the pool person but Bruce informed us that the slimy dirty solar floating devices help heat the pool.    We cleaned the ones we could but some were so slimy and stain I wouldn’t put the slimy devices  in the pool that my grandkids were going to swim in.

The Sunrooms to the front of the house provided a perfect place to sit,  providing ever changing views over the bay to Eyeries.Spectacular sunsets,and crashing waves were better than any television programme.We spent many hours in there with a glass of wine,or cool guinness.    The house is well placed as a base to explore the peninsula and beyond.Close to the villages of Eyeries and Allihies,both of which have places to eat,village shops etc.There is a beach a short walk away.

If you love stunning mountain scenery, not the harsh rocky type but the sort that is filled with dramatic mountain peaks that tower over verdant valleys filled with ancient oak forests and an abundance of flora then this is the place for you.  These secretive and properly wild mountains and valleys are comparatively unknown and little visited, they are a true bastion of exciting wilderness and home to wild boar, brown bear, eagles and wolves, completely uniquely..in Europe certainly.  My kids..boy 13 and girl 8 loved it..the 'Big House' is a beautiful, big old village 'bastide' filled with history and character that sits magnificently on the side of the valley with views from every beautifully shuttered window, that each deserve individual awards.  The real great outdoors is right on the doorstep and after a couple of days of driving off to further flung walking spots [of which there are loads!] we realised after a massive breakfast at the huge old kitchen table that demands such breakfasts, that all we had to do was don our boots and head in any number of directions from the front door to find some proper wilderness adventures right there.  It's real 'Boy's Own' stuff..wild boar tracks everywhere, sticks to whittle and streams to dam..when we were there it was sunny and warm [in April] and we didn't see another soul!    The other great piece of news, for all of us, was that the valley is filled with some absolutely fabulous local inns and restaurants, not the prissy michelin type, but small places run by charming people that serve some of the biggest, freshest and tastiest steaks you'll ever eat and washed down with delicious local wines.  Of course, there is all sorts of other delicious local fare on offer and which we enjoyed, but the steaks took the biscuit and all at a very reasonable price!

The rooms were large as described but the amenities (for $800 USD per day) ware definitely lacking.  Having visited Mexico many times and in various villages and big cities, this was the least satisfying place we stayed.  Had the price been different, then it is possible we could have understood.  The bathrooms, when working, were equipped with shabby and torn towels; the kitchen with chipped and mismatched dishes; the bathroom shower water was tepid at best.  The view was spectacular as noted but to get to the house was extremely difficult with a very, very steep road to the doors - especially hard for anyone with older members in their party.  We had to ask for purified water as there was only one working container in the house.    The rooms were orderly but the maggots under the plunger were less than appealing.  I would never recommend this house to a friend.  It is simply overpriced for the condition of the house.    On the other hand, we LOVED San Pancho and would return again - but needless to say in another location.  Some of our children stayed in town and for a minimal price had a charming house steps from the beach.  The food in restaurants was not inexpensive but worth the price in almost all cases.

Doorwalls were dirty with hand prints, we spent 2 hrs cleaning house. Outdoor BBQ did not work and never did during our stay. Called prop mgr/cleaning lady to complain, she came next day and admitted that the owners left the morning we arrived and she \"didn't really clean\" and promised to refund our cleaning fee. 2nd bed was NOT a queen but a kids bunk bed.

I have stayed in several VRBO rentals, and this is the ONLY bad experience. There was visible dirt on the floors and around the baseboards, cobwebs in many corners, dirty dishes in cabinets, and dirt collecting around and under the beds. Eleven of us had to curtail a much-anticipated weekend because of the unacceptable accommodations.    We paid $200 for cleaning, which suggests that when we arrived, the house should have been clean because of the previous guest's $200 cleaning fee. It was NOT clean. I would much rather see time and money spent on thorough housecleaning than on purchasing crystal, fine china, and bed linens. (For instance, it would be really nice if the mouse droppings were removed from the sofa beds.)    The worst part of the rental was discovering bed bugs in one of the rooms. Bed bugs of several sizes and stages were found, suggesting that they have been house residents for at least several weeks, if not months. A pest control company confirmed their presence and plans to contact the owner directly. The 11 of us repacked our belongings in trash bags, left a day early, and spent hours cleaning and sterilizing things when we got home. This is not just a cleanliness issue: it is a significant health issue, and now we each risk bringing the bugs into our own homes, where many of us have small children.    We did not get what we were promised—a clean, comfortable place to gather. We have requested a refund, but the owner has refused. She has been defensive (\"Bed bugs are a fact of life now for renters and owners and I refuse to accept any blame for their being there\") and difficult to deal with (\"I refuse to accept your making this my fault. Diseases and infestation happen even in the finest of hotels\"). She instead offered a return stay, which addresses neither the bed bugs nor the lack of cleanliness. If VRBO would allow each of us to post a review, there would be 10 others similar to this to help others avoid the same unfortunate situation.

The advert for this property is dishonest about the apartment itself and the location.  Pictures show a swimming pool and lovely beach.  Despite the fact that the property description states that there is a communal pool, the reality is a pool that looks as if it has been closed for years, containing a stagnant puddle and dead leaves surrounded by dirty and broken chairs.  The only beach is a very narrow inlet of rocks and pebbles where it would be impossible to sunbathe or swim.  It isn’t the owners fault the pool has closed but it is his responsibility to advertise honestly and inform potential guests of changes to the advertised description.  The view out of the window is very nice so long as you don’t let your eyes drift down to the corrugated plastic roof covering the balcony of the apartment below and the abandoned pool complex.  The property is approached down a very steep and narrow road with parking at the bottom.  Presumably when it was built, Sueno Azul, the estate in which the property is located, had a lively shopping centre.  Now, apart from a bakery and tiny deli, all of the shops are closed down.  The nearby town of Callao Salvaje is also slightly run down but still has a good choice of reasonably priced bars and restaurants.  What isn’t mentioned in the property description are the 16 steps down, 65 steps up and another 27 steps down to reach the town nor the 40 steps that you have to drag your suitcases up on arrival.  This wasn’t a problem for us but it would be useful information for anyone less able or elderly.  I also struggled to understand how one sofa bed provided ‘comfy’ seating for 7.  It seated 3 people but was far from comfortable.  The alternative was 6 garden chairs or 4 dining chairs.    With the one-way system through the town it takes nearly 10 minutes to reach the motorway and a further 10 minutes to reach the Los Cristianos motorway exit.  If the queues on the motorway slip road were bad the total journey time could be 30 minutes or more.  In the end our only option for a relaxing holiday by the pool was to walk up to the Tropical Park hotel at the far end of Callao Salvaje where they turned a blind eye to non residents so long as you bought food and drinks at their bar.

The experience was not positive and has since caused us anguish. We  had a signed  lease agreement.The agreement specified the rental fees and terms which included a security deposit. The lease stipulated that the security deposit would be returned in 14 days from the lease's end after the house was inspected and found to be undamaged and clean which it was. The lease also specified that we would be responsible for utilities cost over a certain threshold. No where, anywhere including this website was there any mention of taxes, state, county or other. There was also  no mention of a cleaning fee which we found unusual as they are  generally standard in most rental agreements. On the 25th of the month the security deposit refund arrived late and reflected that the owner arbitrarily deducted state and county sales tax and a cleaning fee,  each of which were never specified or for that matter discussed.  Further, there was a deduction for utilities in excess of the allowable which was quite surprising since at no time during the month did we turn the AC or heat on except to heat the pool twice and the jacuzzi a couple of times. . Subsequently, the owner did refund the cleaning deposit and recalculated the utility bill to uncover that he had, in fact, over charged us for utilities. The owner steadfastly refused to refund the taxes which amount to roughly half of the security deposit.  Next is small claims court which appears to be pretty complicated undertaking being from out of state.  Copies of our lease agreement are available to anyone interested.

Not recommended for anyone over 6' tall or 200 lbs.+    While there was next to no noise from the street, there was noise from what sounded like washer/dryers going on up above on several occasions and lots of heavy footsteps upstairs.     The bathroom was accessible from both the bedroom and the kitchen/living area with a very flimsy door, meaning that it's not very private and kind of weird if you don't know the people you're staying with extremely well...    It seemed clean enough, although no additional bedding was provided for the pull-out chair in the 2nd room (kitchen/living area).  It was fine for a couple nights but I probably wouldn't stay for longer than that.    Also, the owner came by at 9:45 on a Friday evening to pick up dirty linens, which seemed a) rude that he would stop by at all b) incredibly inconvenient c) unnecessary since we were only there for 4 days.

Down the street from great shopping/ice cream and right across the river from most major attractions.  About a 20 minute walk to the leather shopping market, and that's about the farthest distance you'll have to travel.    We specifically asked if it was on the first floor/if there was an elevator.  She assured us it was on the first floor, so we wouldn't need an elevator.  We didn't understand that first floor doesn't mean GROUND floor in Europe.  What she didn't mention is that there is a VERY VERY narrow, wooden spiral staircase that you have to climb to get to the apartment.  If I didn't have my husband with me, I don't know how I would have gotten the suitcase up the stairs.  As it was, every day, we had to be very very careful going up and down the stairs.    Small annoyances - there's a washer, but no detergent.  You'll have to try to find the right detergent and buy a full bottle, even if you only need to do one load.  She also only left us one roll of toilet paper.   Not a huge deal, but required us to go find a supermarket the moment we got there.  Not exactly a great beginning.

Entire first day lost dealing with these issues.  Problems with our room key for first 3 days that caused much frustration.  There are no tea towels, dishclothes, dish soap or any basics at all in condo kitchen (very different from our first VRBO experience).  As we were not inclined to purchase everything, we didn't use the kitchen facilities.  However, IB very lovely resort with very pleasant staff.  Beach is gorgeous and snorkelling very good.  Reef is one of the healthiest and nicest we have seen in years - a short swim from shore.  There are a number of restaurants within easy walking distance along the beach, but food in Roatan in general was a bit of a disappointment.  Bite on the Beach nice, Vintage Pearl quite good, and our favourite was Besos in West End - excellent food, drink and atmosphere.  The breakfasts at IB were very good, though inconsistent in their content.  The deli outside the resort also had great breakfasts.  West End short 10 minute water taxi ride away - fun town filled with restaurants and bars.  It was always enjoyable to sip a cold local beer while watching the tourists and locals coming and going.  It is walkable on the beach, though we did encounter 2 young girls who had just been robbed when we tried it and would recommend caution and safety in numbers if walking that end of the beach (beyond Bite on the Beach, where it is much more secluded).    All in all very pleasant and relaxing week.  There are definitely negatives but one shouldn't be put off visiting IB.  The resort feels like it has not yet ironed out all it's kinks, but staff truly friendly and pleasant.  Compared to our first VRBO rental where owner was very accessible and eager to answer all questions, and followed up upon our arrival at his home and after our return home, this owner was much more difficult to contact.  An e-mail sent two weeks prior to our departure with questions went unanswered and there has been no follow-up since our return.  But many positives too - IB and condo beautiful, beach and snorkelling wonderful, people very friendly.  Roatan very laid back, casual - leave your shoes at home!

The description was completely accurate regarding the location, layout and amenities. I was pleasantly surprised when I drove through the Cypress Woods community and entered the house as it far exceeded my expectations! The house was beautiful, spotless, neat and very well organized. The house, yard, and gated community were very well maintained and manicured. The house has been professionally decorated with a model home feeling - beautiful and comfortable furnishings with many updates as listed by the owners. The owners were very helpful, attentive to our needs, and quick to respond to our inquiries. The neighbors were very friendly and helpful, especially Fred. The house has an open floor plan with an excellent layout. The spa overflows into the pool, creating a lovely waterfall. The house overlooks the 8th green which is also a relaxing feature. The location is minutes from groceries and retail shopping, and only 15 minutes from the beaches with Old Naples nearby featuring excellent shops and restaurants. We enjoyed Vanderbilt beach the most. The sunsets are a must. The owners were very generous to share their personal amenities: bikes, beach chairs/umbrella, etc. The club house staff was very accommodating and friendly - offering social events and a delicious menu. The tennis courts, main pool and club house were all within walking distance.  Conveniently located off I-75 with easy access to/from the airport. I would recommend this house to family, friends, and anyone who is looking for a fantastic vacation. The owners were a delight and made sure our stay was enjoyable.

The house is huge, spacious and comfortable, with all the conveniences you can expect from a luxury home.  I love the home theater. The pool is great.  The kitchen is fabulous.  It is so close to the airport, the beach, shopping.  I used to stay with family in PR and did not visit too often, since it was not easy to stay with them.  Now that I found this house, my entire family is eager to go to PR for family activities.  The owners have taken great care to keep it in excellent condition and you feel at home as soon as you arrive.  They also provide recommendations for local restaurants and tips to enjoy your stay.  It is in a gated community so you feel safe and secure.  You do need a car to get around if you want to go to the beaches, Old San Juan and do some sightseeing.  The magnificent PR beaches and weather + this house = a wonderful vacation.

We are very mature, responsible and fair people and we were disappointed beyond words when we arrived at this vacation rental. The house was nothing short of filthy and in overall neglected condition. We contacted the owner immediately and provided pictures of our concerns but were told that they “did not feel obligated to give us any form of refund”. A previous negative review for this property should not be ignored - it is actually very fair based on what we found.  Beyond the dirt, dust and cob webs, we also noted the overall smell in the house has been addressed by installing glade plug in’s in every room – without much success in masking the mouldy odour throughout the house. The kitchen appliances appear to be decades old and on their last legs and the pots and pans were so stained and permanently soiled we would not even cook in the house.  The owner did agree to send someone by to clean the carpets and some furniture and  this carpet cleaning professional even commented on the filthy overall state of the home. We tried cleaning the bed spread but the stains would not wash out and the towels are frayed and old. The house will be cleaner for the next renters because of the cleaning we did ourselves, but this home needs some significant hard core cleaning and overall repairs. Again, as reported in a previous review, there is in fact black mould in the master en-suite shower. In fairness, the back yard is truly amazing and is like a beautiful private park except for the swimming pool which has palm tree roots growing through the side walls, so it too requires some significant repair work.  We have stayed in many vacation rentals but have never felt cheated as we did with this property. It is priced in the range of Palm Springs top end rentals but I would respectfully suggest that this house is grossly over rated and overpriced based on it's extremely neglected condition. I would suggest that future renters should arrange a preview of the property before paying any money if they do consider this rental because the owner will not be very open to refunding anything if you find the home as disappointing as we did.

There are five bedrooms, each of which can sleep two.   It had a very well stocked kitchen (dishes/glasses/pans) etc which we didn't use, but some will certainly want to.   The dining table seats six and there is a couch adjacent for more seating.  I feel the apartment would be crowded if ten stayed there but you certainly could.  We were fine with seven. Horacio provided information on Barcelona ahead of time, then took us on a walking tour of the area to get us oriented.   It was helpful and appreciated.  He will do all he can to ensure that you have a memorable time in his city. I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone.","unitReviewedId":1451652},"2172":{"headline":"Great place to stay","id":2172,"rating":4,"review":"Cosy apartment which is a little basic but in a great location, short walk to all the places you want to see but not on top of everything.

The Casino is right next door and it is fun to just watch at the tables if you are not a gambler.

Another teen slept in the 2nd bedroom and the nine year old slept on the floor with the couch cushions.  We were wishing for twin beds in the 2nd bedroom.

The owner was very angry at my concerns over the lack of proper ventilation for the little gas logs which were the heat for the entire house.  (There were 2 little floor space heaters as well).  The temperature was in the 40's. The house had an extremely strong odor of gas fumes and smelled of improperly vented or combusted propane.  I got out immediately, calling the owner and the caretaker. I was assured that this was normal and no one ever complained! In scrambling to find the caretakers' number as fast as possible (I was afraid the house was going to blow up), I noticed the greeting notes from the owner to the cabin renters.  One line said something like:  \"If you notice a gas odor, don't be concerned as we check it frequently for leaks\".  That tells me I was probably NOT the first to complain. In any event, I was ANGRILY CHARGED FOR THE FULL FOUR DAYS PLUS A CLEANING FEE for the few hours I spent huddled on the porch trying to find reservations somewhere else.  I tried to go inside and get warm, but I ending up getting nauseous and sick to my stomach.   Some other comments:  The house would have 2 window units for AC in the summer, one occupying the only window in the bedroom, near the head of the bed.  There was a severe storm in 2010, and several of the large shade trees by the house were removed, so there is not as much shade as the pictures show.  The river water under the deck was foamy and yellowish, but as long as I looked elsewhere, the view was lovely. The realtor owner has an estate sale business so there are some charming decor items.  But watch out for the vintage Coke cooler on the deck.  The top doesn't close and there was a half inch of standing water in it when I was there - mosquito heaven!  I did not notice screens on any of the doors, so ask about that too.  What else?  There was an enormous commercial gas stove in the tiny kitchen, emitting tons of gas and fumes in addition to those of the fireplace.  It was very hard to actually see myself cooking at it since there was only about a foot of clearance between that and the sink.  (It may be gone by the time you read this). In sum, this house might be fine in the spring or summer.  But cold weather will put you in a nasty fight with the owner over gas fumes and inadequate heat.

This review does not reflect on them as individuals. Upon arrival, the property was not as pictured. The areas pictured on the website were much cleaner and well maintained. There was trash littering the pathway to the beach and at the cabana itself. The entrance to the beach access and at the cabana where severely overgrown and not well kept up. Also no lighting for nighttime excursions. The plastic chairs outside on the patio as well as down by the beach were broken and pieces would stick us in the legs. Not very comfortable to sit on while being stabbed in the leg. Inside the home was clean on the surface but many problems arose during our stay. First off, there is a strong musty odor in the master suite area, smells like mold. The romantic covering in the master bedroom is covered with dust, so if you have allergies, that’s going to cause problems. The kitchen sink was clogged the first day we were their. I used a plunger to unclogg the drain and it was maggots clogging the drain. We had maggots the first 2 mornings in the drain and on the counter top. The toilets also clogged very easily and had to be plunged. There were a lot of roaches and bugs. The games in the game room had broken pieces and missing parts. The battery in the smoke alarm by the master suite was low and beeped all day and all night. There were multiple lamps with burnt light bulbs. The VCR in the twin bedroom did not work. The TV in the queen bedroom did not work. One set of blinds in the game room was broken and falling off the window. The advertised rod/reels were not of great quality and were only half usable. If you’re avid fishermen you may want to bring your own.  If you plan on grilling, either ask owner to fill propane or be prepared to fill them yourself. Laundry room was a blessing. Although, the water does smell very strong of sulfur, it is nice to do laundry as needed. Lots of counter space for folding laundry. The distance to Publix is a little further than we anticipated but it wasn’t too bad.  Overall, it wasn’t a horrible experience, we all enjoyed our time with family but the pictures were deceiving therefore we were not expecting what we saw. To be honest, all this place really needs is a good cleaning, behind and under furniture and the plants need to be maintained and the pathways and cabana area need some attention. The outdoor furniture also needs to be replaced. $1276 for 5 days we expected more.

I was not impressed with the fact that the beach washed away 3 years ago and the stairs have still not been repaired and that it was not mentioned in the ad.  The beach pictured belong to the hotel/condo next door.  No access to your beach.  The BBQ's were some of the worst I have seen.  Could not hold heat and took forever to cook anything, by then it was all dried out.  As for the condo itself....it needs some major TLC and updating.  Living room furniture is very uncomfortable and the fact that one entire wall is covered in mirror, its size is very deceptive.  It implies there are 2 bedrooms and there are not.  One becomes a bedroom of sorts when you pull a huge double slided that rattles in the wind as there is no base to hold it in place.  If using the second bedroom, that 2 patio doors shown become one as the second is now part of your bedroom.  Every single screen in the place was torn, ripped or the frame itself was broken.  The condo itseld was not bad but definitely has seen better days.  Suggest you close for a week or 2 and remodel/update and repair, it is long over due.  Needed to call a repaird 2x for the kitchen appilance.  For the money I paid for 2 weeks, I was overall disappointed.  The pictures implied a very lux condo and I suppose it was in its day...but that day has past.  Had several opportunuties to see some of the other condo's in the same building and they were much nicer inside and seemed to better upkept.  The furniture was more comfortable and updated.

Being there on a golf vacation during the Masters, it would have been nice to watch the Master's after playing our round. Since the TV in the living room only recieved one english speaking channel we could only watch DVD's. The fitted sheet on one bed had a good 10 inch tear in it. The pinball machine in the garage (movie theater room) does not work. I'm not sure what the picture posted of the 'theater room' (garage) is showing because there isn't a 52\" flatscreen TV as implied by the picture. The pool table is not level (even with the cardboard they have under the legs). Only two pool queues have tips but I guess you really only need one. So, bring lots of movies (not bluray) and your own sheets and clean everything first. Overall not bad, great potential but a little disappointing so I'd give it an average.

First the $100 cleaning fee was ridiculous; the house was NOT clean. Spider webs in every ceiling corner, along the walls. We killed many spiders. The upstairs ceiling fan had so much thick lint dust on the blades we were afraid to turn it for fear of having clumps of lint flying everywhere (we all have allergies). Other ceiling fans were almost as bad with lint, maybe not as thick, but we had to clean the couple we used. All floors looked like they hadn't been vacuumed or swept in months. When I pushed aside living room furniture looking for my grandson's toy, the dust/dirt under the furniture was like it hadn't been cleaned in a year. The right side sink leaked; we didn't know it until we looked for detergent to go in the dishwasher and found standing water in the cabinet bottom. We had to clean that mess up. My husband determined it was the right side sink pipes that leaked so we couldn't use that side at all. There was no detergent for dishwasher, not enough cooking utensils, no hand towels for the kitchen, just some dishwashing cloths and cloth table mats. The downstairs bathroom by the stairs had a mirror with black bears and woodsy looking stuff on the bottom half of the mirror. I'm a short person, I could see only from my nose up in that mirror. The Master bath and upstairs bath did not have even one single towel bar or hook to hang a towel on. Couldn't hang them up to dry so we could reuse. There were no hand towels in the Master bath and maybe one each in the other bathrooms. Who wants to spend their weekend washing towels because there weren't enough? A comfy recliner and lamp in the corner of the Master bedroom would have been much nicer than the hard wicker-type chairs and glass table that was there. We checked in a storage room under the stairs looking for maybe beach chairs/toys, etc, but what we found was the nasty smell of a dirty mop that had been put in there wet and dirty instead of being rinsed and dried first. There were 6 of us, with not enough seating on the deck for us all. Burners on grill were rusted; didn't work well. No beach chairs for the deck or to carry down to the beach. No beach towels. Most disappointing was beach and boat dock: Dock lights/boat lift did not work at all; Beach was dirty with rotted, blackened leaves washed in and not raked up. Couldn't find rake to use.

The BBQ grill was rusty; all the protection was gone on half the surface.  We have the impression that all used and old fashion kitchen stuff were just drop in the house while new ones were bought for the owners.  We had problems twice with the internet; once we asked for help, next time we found a solution ourselves. The manager/owner came once to try (without success) to repair the leaking sink.  The bath was very slow to drain; a plumber came one morning and waited half an hour for the owner who never showed up, so no repair were done.

The apartment is not the one advertised. We were given an apartment which is not decorated to anywhere near the standard of the one advertised, which clearly was a let down. Some furniture items are the same, but I'd challenge anyone to come to a different conclusion than it is to a lower standard.    The washing machine was a death trap: it actually burnt (yes, burnt) a whole load of washing we put in. There was a massive water leak from the bottom and we returned to find the kitchen floor soaked with water.    The internet access was a LAN cable. A PC was provided, but the screen didn't work. Although the advert says there is WiFi, there was not. There was also no DVD player, despite this also being advertised.    Having raised all this with the owner/manager/agent on my return the general attitude was one of couldn't-care-less. I was eventually offered a GBP100 rebate, which was completely unacceptable (and wasn't accepted).

Kaz, the owner's business coordinator/representative, was very nice, and he went out of his way to accommodate our last minute booking, including coming in person to collect a cash payment. He was very gracious and kind. His English is very good so communicating with a house representative should not be a concern for a prospective renter.  Our concern relates to the house itself. It was not so inexpensive as to excuse some of the conditions we found. Granted, we rented on short notice, but the owner did have 24 hours advance notice of our arrival. In general, the house was not well cleaned at all. The kitchen area is antiquated and quite dirty. There were cobwebs here and there, hair on the kotatsu blanket and floor, plastic coverings over some of the furniture, and the kitchen table is an antique chest that is knee to hip height.

As we enjoyed Buenos Aires so much, we are looking to return next March. While looking for accomodations for next year we happened to look at the reviews for this place, and based on that review I felt a need to comment.  I saw that the \"Disappointed California\" guest that stayed here starting on March 10, 2010 stated that that the internet did not work and that it was essential for them.  We had the identical experience. Before we rented this place we asked whether the internet service was reliable and we made it clear that emailss for my business were essential.  I was assured that it was.  Well it was not.  We spent frustrated hours trying to get it to work, to no avail.  We called the owners and the local agent severeal times to try to get it fixed and they told us that they never had a problem with the internet  with the clear suggestion being that it was \"operater error\" on our part.   We were forced to it in neighborhood cafes to use the internet.  From reading \"Dissapointed from California\" I realize that it was not only us that had this problem so I feel better about myself, but worse about the owner (I admit that I assume that California contacted the owner about this problem, but his review doe not explicitly state that ).  We did have the same problem with the light being out in the hallway and not being able to get into the apartment, and apparently California complained about that and it was not fixed before we got there.  In addition to California's problems, the entrance door handle and lock literally fell off while we were trying to get into the place in the dark and no I was not kicking the door although I was tempted to do so.  Dispite all the shortcomings the neighborhood was great for restaurants and bars.

We stayed the nights of February 19/20; I received a partial refund of my deposit via check a month later on March 18th.    I was bothered by the time it took to receive my deposit back and then even more bothered by the unexpected cleaning fee I was charged.  I was told the stove was \"a mess\" and that the linens were left in a pile on the floor.  So that's nearly half of the deposit to more thoroughly clean the stove and to put the linens in a neater pile?  Absurd.  Our group was so careful to take our boots off outside as to not dirty the carpet since there was no entry mat on the inside of the unit.  We used cleaning spray to thoroughly wipe down all of the counters and stove.  Ran the dishwasher, put the linens in a bin as instructed, and still we were charged a cleaning fee.  Sure, we didn't scrub the bathrooms or vacuum the floor, but I didn't know that level of clean was required; there was nothing that told us so.  Apparently it was.    There is nothing bad or special about the unit; there are many others like it in Meadow Ridge.

This lovely, beachfront estate was the perfect site for a traditional New England wedding!  This venue would accommodate intimate weddings, anniversary celebrations, retreats, reunions, or extended family vacations beautifully.  The home is lovely - very roomy and welcoming for guests of all ages.  The facilities are wonderful.  The gourmet kitchens, sun porches and common areas, the numerous large bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as the private beach, all in beautiful seaside surroundings, make it a perfect place to entertain family and friends and celebrate a special occasion.  The home is very comfortable, with its own distinct charm – a great place to relax and enjoy life!  Many opportunities exist for pursuing outdoor leisure and water-related sports and activities.  There is plenty of space to accommodate those who want to relax privately, gather in small groups, or enjoy being with the group at large.  We especially enjoyed that our close family and friends were able to spend the entire weekend with us and that we could enjoy preparing many special meals together.  In addition to being pleasant, helpful and accommodating, Kate, one of the family members who owns and manages the home, was very efficient in helping to meet our needs, answer our many questions, and make excellent referrals for various caterers and vendors.  Family members, Lew and Lauren, were on-site to greet us when we arrived and make sure the home was in pristine condition. We have such special memories of the wedding weekend at Southwest at Little Harbor. For the quintessential New England experience, celebrate your special occasion here!

Apart from the general dirty and poor condition of much of the furniture, fixtures and fittings and kitchenware, there are a number of civil code violations of the housing standards contained in the Uniform Housing Code enforced by California Local Government meaning that this property is not properly tenantable.

A portion of the home is used for a business; as a renter, you do not have access to this section of the property (understandably), and with this particular property, we observed unknown individuals frequently in the business portion of the home in the early to late evenings.  Hense, actual privacy is a bit limited.    There is minimal parking available.  The owners lock the garage and do not allow renters to use it, despite what the previous post says.  Street parking is a bit tight, particuarly if you have a party requiring more than 2 vehicles.  It is a very safe area, so walking a distance is not dangerous-just inconvenient.  The house itself is adequate and fairly well-maintained, save for a few holes and scratches in the walls. It has appropriate furnishings and plenty of kitchen items.  Towels and sheets are quite worn and scratchy, so much so that we brought over towels from my home to use.  Key in door is difficult to use.  There is a small patio but no yard.  We could not locate toilet paper or paper towels and therefore had to buy more.  It appears as though the owners might live here when the home is not being rented; their personal items and photos are all over the house.  Items such as hand towels in the bathrooms were not provided.  There are 4 bedrooms: master w/king, 1 w/queen, 1 w/2 twins, 1 w/twin.  TV has cable and a DVD player.

The hot tub, the main reason we went rented this property, was not heated when we arrived and would not heat up. After much tinkering, we got it heated (which took a total of 36hours). Upon leaving the property we could not turn the heating down. Obviously we could not get in touch with anyone to inform them of this.  There are many CD, DVD and Wii games cases at the property. Virtually all of them are empty. The Wii provided was therefore redundant. Even the board games were depleted (we attempted a game of monopoly but gave up as most of the cards / money was missing).

We were not intending on being noisy, but this is still not the first thing you want to hear when arriving at a holiday home.The property is about a 25minute drive from Edinburgh. City centre parking is expensive, but the property cannot be blamed for that.  Overall, I recommend people avoid this property at all costs.

We kept the owner informed by cell-phone of our travel problems and she left milk, bread and danishes for us. She also sent us extremely accurate directions to the condo from the airport.  We stayed at this condo for a month, and when the time was up we were happy to leave. The furniture was terrible, the bed was called a mombassa bed, but it was the most uncomfortable bed.  There was no picture of the kitchen on the listing, and for a good reason, the stove was an extremely old model with broken plates. When we tried to sit on the couch the cushions just slid out from under us. My wife woke up with a sore back and hip on most mornings. There were two extremely old tv sets with small screens and you could only get about 8 stations. The owner charged the highest rates, but it was definitely not worth the money. It was listed as having an ice-maker, but the ice-maker was plastic trays you put in the freezer to make ice cubes.  We rented a unit in the same facility this year for three hundred dollars a month less and it had a stainless steel fridge with a real \"ice-maker\", perfect furniture, 2 large flat screen tvs that could each get about 300 channels.  During our stay this year we met the current tenants at the pool and they had nothing but aches and pains to show for their stay. I told the tenant to complain to the landlord and write a review, however, he said the same thing as I said last year, I will not go back. This comment encouraged me to write this review, it is best to let other future tenants know what they are getting and request the proper information from the owner.  I encourage all tenants of any condo to write a review for all prospective tenants to see, be it good or bad.  I will not recommend this condo.

We could never take off our shoes.  The owners were kind & friendly, but were deceptive, stating \"shared pool\".   There was none on the property, which was a huge disappointment given the condition of the beach, especially.  No BBQ grill either.  A rusty grate on rocks was was not santitary.  The well water showers were cold & very salty.  (We were told on the phone the water was warm.)   The owners eventually loaned us a cattle heater to warm a bucket of salt water for showers.  You must rent a car in Merida or Progresso, as transportation was a huge issue we didn't know about from the listing.  We are seasoned travelers who use public transportation everywhere but this location was very challenging.  The bus (to Merida) came by at 11:30 a.m. with a transfer in Chicxulub to get to Progresso & a late night return with another transfer.   Not convenient at all.  There are no taxis in Telchac & the collectivos have no regular schedules.  The walk to town for bread, snacks & restaurants was nearly 2 miles.  You had to go to another town...Progresso or Motul... to buy groceries.  Both of us were sick more than once from the restaurants, so cooking was essential.  There were too many challenges, including a big storm that flooded the palapa.  We left Telchac early despite paying in advance.  We note that another Telchac Puerto listing states \"pristine beaches\", which is so not true.   Our wish for all travelers is clear, true & helpful information from all the owners' listings.

This house is a 2 bedroom house with a sun room that has no door to a living room. So one family had to sleep in the living room and we had to compromise on a lot of fun things to do because small children had to go to bed early. Sun room is almost unusable for sleeping at winter time due to a bad window insulation and very cold flooring anyway. Other things to note would be lack of toilet paper, no dishwasher liquid , dishwasher not working at all, shower next to 2nd bedroom not working properly with water being stuck in the tub, flushing handle of toilet in the 2nd bathroom stuck after each flush... etc etc.. Not to mention that there was no hot water the first night because of the water heater turned off by a circuit breaker.

This was a last minute getaway for us and this property was one of few still vacant in the area.  We used to live in the area and wanted to re-visit our old friends and favorite spots.    We were a bit disappointed to see that this was not a single family home but is instead  part of a 12-unit complex.  The ad stated \"house\" and never mentioned \"townhome\" or \"condo\", which seems a more fitting description.  Additionally, the owners have a place next door and keep close tabs on the rental,so not much for privacy .  Read the lease! We did not, unfortunately. Only those listed on the lease are allowed to enter the dwelling.  You must ask the owner if you can have a friend stop by!  Also, no photos of the vacation rental can be taken.  We got the tongue lashing of our lives from the owner when a friend stopped by to meet our baby with her tiny accessory dog in tow.  The owner was so controlling about the place that it  made us feel uncomfortable to be there at all.  She pointed out the cost of things, emphasized the \"famousness\" of the home several times and also requested that you not prepare food directly on the kitchen countertops, etc. Definitely not a \"make yourself at home\"  atmosphere. It's like staying in a museum, basically.  I felt like I was on eggshells...  Perhaps the worst part:  The property has no central heat.  There are two tiny fireplaces and a couple space heaters in the unit. Neither did much to warm the place up, and all heat sources were dangerous to leave on while asleep, so no heat at night and temps dipped into the lower 40s during our stay.  We notified the owner after our first night in the home that we were very cold but she did not offer to bring over more heaters or help to make us more comfortable.  We froze!  Other unpleasant surprises:  The downstairs bedroom/bathroom has the toilet  about 3 feet away from the bed with nothing but a small divider between the two.  There is no door on the upstairs bath, just a curtain - doing your business is never a private experience.  You must go outside and climb some narrow concrete steps to access the upper bed and bath. Scary for both my elderly mom and baby.  There is no door between the outdoors and the upper bed and bath.    The pros:  very nice and large deck with some ocean views.

We also had trouble opening the lock on the door but finally got in. During our stay someone had emptied what looked like the contents of a vacuum cleaner bag on the landing above our place.  The first time we opened the door we noticed a musty smell.  The carpeted stairs to the master suite appeared not to have been vacuumed at all. There was popcorn behind the furniture and specs of dirt along the floor boards.   The hot tub was cold and would not heat up.  We called and a maintenance person came over twice and cleaned the filter but after 3 days we did not get to enjoy the hot tub at all which was a huge disappointment to some in our group. (We should have known when the disclaimer reads \"no refunds for non working appliances or equipment\")  Everyone we spoke with seemed helpful and friendly but nothing was ever done for us to compensate for our inconvenience and disapointment.  One of the bedrooms upstairs has sky lights which prevented 2 of our guests from enjoying a good nights sleep.  This room was never meant to be a bedroom.  One of the upstairs shower faucet handles was dripping when we arrived and so we never even used that shower.  You also receive a checklist of things to do when you leave (starting the dishwasher, etc) which should be what a routine housekeeper is paid to do (not a condo guest.)  It felt a little like boy scout camp.  I wouldn't stay here again nor would I recommend this property.  When I travel I want to feel that everything has been done before I arrive to assure my satisfaction and enjoyment ... that's what you pay for and look forward to getting out of town for.  I want to relax ... not fix things.  Also the DVD player/cable t.v. needs a splitter which costs about $1.00 so that both options are available to the guests.  This property was probably beautiful back in it's day but it's not welcoming in the way that guests expect.  It is old and has seen better days.  With some diligence it could be a lot better than it is.  Too bad so many people have had to experience this the hard way.  The little nuances do matter when you arrive at a vacation destination.

We experienced some good things but also some very bad things.  When we showed up Friday night, our passcode would not work.  We had to call the owner to use her \"secondary\" code to allow us in.  That is not a big issue and is just a minor detail but it is a problem that could and should have been realized before we arrived.  When you pay this sort of money, some times the small things count the most.    Then we started cooking. The kitchen was one of the very nice things about the cabin.  But afterwards, we had planned on relaxing in the hot tub and winding down from a 5 hr trip.  That wasn't able to happen b/c the hot tub was COLD.  We called for hot tub service and they said \"give it time...it was just cleaned an hr ago.  It self heats.\"  We took that answer even though we shouldn't have b/c it should be ready to go by the time you get there if you pay the money for that feature!  We emailed the owner afterwards and she said \"Yes, the Hot tubs do take several hours to heat up.  This is listed in the terms and conditions and will happen at any cabin where it is a guest change over day where the hot tubs are just cleaned.(There is a lot of gallons of water to heat up).\"  The problem is that despite what is said there, when you expect someone to pay a couple hundred dollars..they should have the entire package available.  Cleaning the hot tub should have been done hours before so there was not a waiting period.  Then to make matters worse...the hot tub was still not hot by night time and in fact, it didn't get hot all weekend so it appears that it was a problem with the hot tub heating system.  This would have been figured out if they cleaned it Thursday and tested it Friday before we got there.  I am sure at that point the owner would have responded with \"we couldn't do that b/c we had people staying there Thursday night.\"  I'm sorry but when you accept a couple hundred dollars from me for 1 weekend, then I will expect that feature to be working ON TIME.  If that means you take a day off in between allowing guests to stay in order to test every issue that may arise, then that is what you need to do in order to ensure EVERY guest has a stay worth the money they are paying for this cabin instead of spending it on another cabin elsewhere...by the end of the stay, we felt as if we upheld our end of the agreement by paying up front...we deserved every feature available but that didn't happen.....","unitReviewedId":1445763},"6455":{"headline":"Great Location - Major Mechanical Problem","id":6455,"rating":2,"review":"We stayed at Yellow Dog Cottage in the summer of 2010. The location was amazing. The house is set on a sheltered, pristine cove with a private dock and gorgeous view. We rented kayaks and spent many hours paddling the beautiful tidal cove. Waldoboro is a very small town and is some ways away from the house, so you have to plan supply trips into town. It's a rural location, which suited us but might not be for everyone. The house was simple but comfortable, though the upstairs room was a little strange with virtually no light and no electrical outlets.     The biggest problem we had was with the water. We were told the house slept 5, and it was myself and my four children. We were very cautious with the water as we were told there was an elaborate water system in place due to the proximity to the cove and that as long as we \"didn't use more water than is reasonable\", it should be fine. Basically, we took two short showers in the morning and two short showers at night, with my youngest daughter fitting one in when she could. We ran the dishwasher once a day and that was about it, and we had MAJOR water problems. The water shut off entirely several times, requiring the local handyman to come in and reset everything followed by a long wait for the tanks to refill. During this time, we couldn't even flush the toilets.    Katherine did offer me a partial refund when I asked, but I was disappointed when I inquired about renting the cottage again this year to discover that the water situation has not been fixed. Furthermore, Katherine seemed to blame the problems on our \"excessive\" use of water, which was upsetting giving how cautiously we approached the whole situation while there. If the water can't be fixed because of the proximity to the cove, the listing should clearly state that this cottage sleeps less than 5, because in my opinion, it's perfectly reasonable to expect that each person get one brief shower a day.     The only other problem we had was the authorized use of the Yellow Dog dock by an early morning lobsterman. Said lobsterman was lovely, but the fish guts and traps strewn across the dock along with the excessive noise of his boat motor at 5am was not. Wish we'd known about this in advance.     All this said, if the noise doesn't bother you and you have only a couple of people (or don't plan on showering everyday) in residence, Yellow Dog offers a simple place to stay in a stunning location.

It took a little over an hour for the water to get hot again.  After another bath and shower the water was cold again.  I sent an email to the owner asking her if this issue was going to be fixed and her response was:  “The only thing I can recommend is that you take showers at different times of the day.”  After letting her know my disappointment to this suggestion she replied with:  “When I've stayed with groups the size of yours, we have always planned some evening showers.  I'm sorry our hot water heater is not large enough for everyone at the same time.”  We certainly did not expect to be able to only bathe two at a time and then have to wait over an hour for the water to get hot again.  We have travelled with much larger groups and never had a problem with hot water.  The condo slept 4-6, and our group did not exceed this number. If you rent a place that sleeps 4 – 6, the hot water heater should accommodate baths/showers for that number of people.  The owner’s response to the hot water issue was ridiculous.  I can’t imagine any group on vacation considering renting a place that required baths/showers to be taken at different times throughout the day.

The only bathroom is inside the only bedroom (the one with the queen bed).  That bedroom doesn't have a door, only a curtain as a \"door\".  If you have a group and are in the queen bed bedroom get used to hearing everyone's bathroom business.  During the check-in, the owner mentioned that there was some ice cream in the freezer and that they would be down later to get it while we were out...a little odd and presumptuous I think.  The first night there we wanted to turn the heat up and found that the heating controls are in the owner's apartment.  There were not any extra blankets around in the apartment.  We tried to contact the owner via phone...no luck.  We knocked on the owner's door two separate times.  The owner (and the live in friend/housekeeper) came down not long after, barged into the apartment without notice and began berating my fiance about the heating situation and how it is computer controlled in her apartment. Mind you, my fiance was trying to sleep and in the bed!  The owner used some pretty foul and demeaning language completely uncalled for which included \"Do you want me to wipe your a** for you too?\".  Needless to say, we were a bit concerned about future intrusions from then on.   Fortunately, we were out most of the time.  All you really get here is location.  Don't expect anything really extravagant.  It's more like a hostel than anything with some really outdated furniture and a small bathroom which needs a new shower curtain.

When you decide to rent it think twice – most likely you won’t get your deposit back in full which is not modest – a significant portion of it will be withdrawn by the owner for \"cleaning purposes\" even though you pay a separate flat rate for the cleaning services and he will refer you to the quote from his agreement, which you have to sign previously to maintain the property in the same condition in which it was found. An excellent, perfect ground to get your deposit ripped off for any reason.  I left apt in perfect condition (took pictures before we left), nothing was broken: dish washed all the dishes, no trash was left in apt, piled all used bedding sets and towels (bath and beach). It was not good enough. The owner claimed that the laundry loads (we were allowed to use all available towels in the closet) exceeded his 'normal' amount what is equal to 2 loads. He had to do 5 loads instead. I believe 2 loads could be not enough even for 2 people staying on the beach; we had a family there. For an extra 3 loads he withdrew an additional significant amt from my deposit just for cleaning. Pretty impressive charge. Another thing that was not mentioned by owner before we came – there was work arranged to be done on the balcony during our stay to replace tiles and clean the area with water pressure. (“Huge balcony bonus” per owner’s ad) so we lost more than a week out of 3 weeks of our 'bonus', which was a huge part of the apartments original appeal for us!!! Workers were a part of our family... with dust– quite a big bonus!  In the end the apartment might be not a bargain as owner claims on VRBO site: \"My rental fee is a bargain ! It is below the normal rate on this building plus you get the bonus of a huge balcony .\"  Renter beware: you can and probably will lose your deposit if laundry loads exceed the 'normal' amount. Also, be careful with towels, bring them with you to avoid penalty!    In addition you’ll collect cigarettes on your bonus huge balcony floor on a daily basis, which are thrown down from upper-level small balconies. You will not be reimbursed for cleaning it up. Nor will you be thanked for or in any way appreciated for maintaining the balcony and the apartment in great condition.  Big tip/piece of advice: take pictures before your departure!

The down stairs bed is held up by bricks and is broken so you have to lay wrong on it if two people sleep on it. (so you don't roll to the middle) There is animal pee marks all over the floor, it white carpet. All the beds that are said to be new a hard as a rock its like sleeping on the floor. When we woke up to take a shower the next day there was no hot water. Let me tell you a cold shower is not a fun way to start your day with a bride on her wedding day. So they had to come fix that. I my contract there was nothing about the pool heating fee I was told that when I got there. When you walk into the master bath you see a nice jetted bath tub you just want to jump in a relax,but think agian the jets doen't work. Also you have to take off your shoes on the white carpet so you don't pay the extra cleaning fee and the carpet hurts your feet because it is so ruff. My tenth moonth old would try to crawl and would just cry cause it hurt his legs. Over all the house it self is nice, it smells, the beds are hard and broken, good luck on hot water, and don't mind a drop in from the owner. I hope you have a better trip then I did. Its a good price but I would say pay alittle more and stay so where else!!!!","unitReviewedId":1351662},"9077":{"headline":"Stay at Portifino Island Resort in Pensacola","id":9077,"rating":1,"review":"  All the beds were rock hard.  The roll-out bed was missing springs, and was extremely uncomfortable.  There were streamers still up on the walls, broken light bulbs, floors unmopped, and cooking utensils and can opener dirty.  The coffee maker stopped working on the sixth day.  Also, there was a large crack in the door jamb of the master closet.  The master shower's handle broke on the third day.    The staff was friendly, but initially I paid for the package at Adventure Cove before we arrived to get the internet discount.  I was told I paid for the \"premiere\" package, to include motorized activities, in a telephone conversation I had with a staff member. I was e-mailed that a certain dollar amount had been added to my account, but no written confirmation of what package I had actually purchases. When I arrived, I was told I paid for the deluxe package, and that staff referred to the deluxe package as the premiere package.  To recieve the \"premium\" package, I would have to pay three hundred dollars more.  Then I learned there was also a premium club package.  Confused?  Everyone involved was.  When I checked out, I was told I had a balance of three-thousand dollars!  It seems my account was charged for the premium package, at full price, on a daily basis!    It took a manager to come forward to correct the billing problem.  What would have happened had the manager not been present?  I hadn't seen that particular young lady all week.      I called the front desk the morning I checked out to ask for what specifically needed done before I left.  I was told to wash all the towels, but leave the trash for housekeeping.  Yet at check out, I was told that I did not need to wash towels but needed to empty trash!  Thank goodness I had already emptied trash before I left.  Whoever is in charge of management of these facilities need to take a better look at staff and maintenance.  I cannot recommend these facilities, and it is a shame.  They do have some wonderful amenities and real potential, if management had it all together.","unitReviewedId":1400688},"6430":{"headline":"Nice farm, difficult experience","id":6430,"rating":2,"review":"I was looking for a nice acommodation for one night in Biloxi. I called Green Woods Stables and they said they had a new unit which would satisfy my requirement for two separate sleeping spaces, one for us and the other for teen girls.  They said they usually only rent for two nights but would rent for one since it was a week night. The day before I was to arrive, they called that the accommodation was not ready. Construction was in progress. They could sleep us all on futons and a couch in one area. Since they had already charged my credit card, I asked for my money back. They said that they had another house for which I would have to pay a nominal additional amount. I suggested that I go ahead and get my money back and they said ok, come on we will rent this at the same cost as the other. I asked for directions and they said to google it. I called the owner on my way to advise of my location and to try to estimate arrival time. We arrived in Biloxi after an 8 hour drive and got lost. A street sign was missing and our googled directions were not clear. Finally we arrived at the farm. It was very pretty property with several houses and barns and horses. The kids had to use the bath room. We called the owner and she said she had just sat down to dinner and it would be 10 minutes. After a much longer duration my kids were still needing to use the bath room and we went over to the owner's house. They were not welcoming to us and after more delay they finally came with us to the rental unit. The unit had a mildew smell but otherwise seemed clean. It was warm and the kids started a ceiling fan and a cloud of dust came from the top of the fan. We then decided to start the AC. We opened the AC closet and the unit was quite moldy - very black all over, so we dropped that idea. We went to bed and found that there was only one sheet on the bed and no more sheets in the place. We then used the bathroom and found there was no toilet paper. This went on and on. The people basically considered us a nuisance instead of tired travelers. It was a terrible experience. They never apologized for anything, rather just made us feel like intruders. I am certain they will deny everything and refuse to permit this to post, since VRBO allows owners to take down negative reviews.  For the record we gave our next hotel in New Orleans five stars and are very grateful for owners who provide clean, well stocked facilities and are hospitable to travelers.

I looked for a house EIGHT MONTHS before my wedding to ensure we got the perfect place. This cottage has amazing reviews and I contacted Helen to discuss.   She was very nice on the phone and said she would let us be the only 2 night rental of the summer but we were considering renting for 3 nights. The house was going to be the perfect place for my photos getting ready and to be with my new husband. Today, 13 weeks from my wedding, Helen sends an email, doesn't CALL, and yes, I sent her a check and signed contract EIGHT months ago, to tell me she is sending my check back because she just found out her family member is having a wedding my same weekend.   She said she went on VRBO and there are others still available. Oh, yeah, any other house will do for the first night I'm MARRIED. I looked at NINE other houses before picking hers and all of them are now booked because we're 13 weeks out.   Interesting, I got on VRBO and see that she doesn't even have my weekend blocked off, it says on here it's still AVAILABLE. So one would say she probably got an offer for a full week and is taking the more money over her original word. I've been in tears all morning because I was SO excited when we got this house, it was the one my mom loved the most, which yes, Helen knows as we talked about it.   I'm sure this house is beautiful and wonderful but why support people who can do such a thing.   E  Hello Jessica,   I have bad news for you regarding your stay in our Sonoma cottage..I just wanted to let you know that David's sister (my husband) just announced to our family last night that she is planning a small family wedding in Sonoma on the same weekend that you have arranged and paid to stay in our cottage.  I feel very bad about this but family comes first and I am going to have to send your check back and cancel your stay.   I went on vrbo.com last evening and there are still several homes with availability for that weekend.  I apologize for this and feel real bad but we have to use the house for us and for his sister and her fiancé.     I will be putting your check back in the mail to you first thing next week.

I haven't looked at this listing untill today and seen that someone had the same issues as us with the Geccos. The 2 nights we spent there were the most disturbing nights of sleep I ever had.Coming from a rural town in Saskatchewan, Canada I have seen my share of mice and rats, but never in my home.... Now when Carol said there is nothing we can do as they are the natural pest of the island thats fine, but at home Mice are our pests and like I said I have never had a mouse in my house here, and in one night we counted up to 8 geccos on the wall. That was one thing but the gecco droppings were on the rug, on the walls, on the window sills, it was everywhere,We wouldn't even leave our suitcases unzipped. We were going to make a Pizza in the oven and when we opened it it was the most digusting thing I have seen. Also she excleded to tell us that the kitchen had a 1 foot drop off when she knew we had a 1 year old child with us. The room our daugter was to sleep in had ants crawling up the wall & the light socket crackeled & buzzed when we turned it on. We were scared of fire & did not want insects crawling on our 1 year old. Needless to say, we did not have her sleep in that room & slept with us instead. That was a let down to us, as we chose this proprty so we could give her a seperate room from us & our friends. The yard said it was enclosed & really is not. The house next door was under extensive renovations, so on day 3 we told Carol that we had enough and wanted our money back. She seemed shosked and said that it has never happened before, now I see on a difefrent review this wasn't the first instance. Anyway we got next to nothing  $$ back ( for sleeping there 2 nights out of the 10) and we went and rented a way nicer place for a lot cheaper in the same area. We wrote Carol a letter when we got back and never recieved a response so  I guess that is how much she cares .Since this has happened to others, it makes me wonder maybe this is what they want, what an easy way to make money. Rent out the place for 2 nights & keep 2/3rds of the money. Seems easy to me. Any way my word of advice is there is nice places  for less money so keep looking. Don't let this place ruin your holiday like it just about ruined ours.

The owners were unaware of our problems encountered by their prop.manager until we arrived home.  Although they didn't know what was going on, they should still be responsible. We received a sincere apology, however, no refund of any kind. We paid for a service we did not get.  The beach was also not as nice as told. There was sea grass rolling in all the time onto the beach and to go into the ocean you had to walk over 2 -3 feet of rocks. This place is also extremely noisy except on the 1st floor.  There is a Wal-Mart superstore and a Costco. There are also several small markets to buy food. Getting around by bus was very easy. We did enjoy our time in Cancun.

We had seen complaints online about the owner not returning deposits but decided to go anyway. After our arrival and full payment he started to request a 15% deposit which is not indicated anywhere and not discussed at the time of reservation. I sent him a small USD 150 deposit. When we left he said that in monthly rentals the guest should pay the utilities so he wouldn't return the deposit. This of course was never indicated anywhere and he didn't answer my mails from this point onwards. Be aware that this person asks for the deposit with no intention of returning it. If you still choose to go, for some reason, don't pay any deposit even if he asks. When we were there he was also sent a court subpoena by other guests who had been double booked during our stay and he hadn't returned the money paid. During our stay we paid the repairs of bathrooms, A/C and delivery of gas that he promised to reimburse but never did. The apartment is in very bad shape and most things start to break in steady use. His housekeeper for the place never got anything done when help was needed and outright lied about gas delivery or maintenance people being 5 minutes away and later admitted not even having called anybody. Apart from the owner, Antonio Lira, another negative point about this huge condominium is the bad attitude of the management. Every day you could see guest argueing with them about something and the answers are very insulting. The last 2 days we were without running water in our section of the area and they had not bothered to arrange for any temporary facilities for the guests. They had ordered water trucks to fill the pools but didn't care to organize anything for the guests.  The owner has a clear pattern of stealing the guests' money so please be warned about that. Also be prepared to pay for the heavy maintenance of the place yourself as the owner won't reimburse you. Don't count on the condo management for any help in anything.

The unit is so close to the ocean that it was difficult to sleep, and neither of us are light sleepers. We also found the bed to be very uncomfortable and would likely try to find a unit next time with AC. The location next to White Sand beach is very good and close to downtown Kona. One thing to keep in mind is to re-read your contract before you leave. We booked in advance and have rented through VRBO many times, assuming the $75.00 cleaning fee was similar to a one-time maid service in a hotel and that is not the case. If you read your contract, make sure to note that the cleaning doesn't really cover much of anything. We left the trash half full and just a few dishes behind not thinking anything of it. We were later charged for this and also cited for \"extra sand\", although we are very clean people and thoroughly rinsed off in the shower outside before returning to the unit each trip. In fact, of all our beach trips in hotels and otherwise, the room was as clean at the end of the week as we had ever experienced. At the end of the day, we were very disappointed about the additional charges and wish we had re-read contract before departing. We were unhappy with how we were treated and will definitely rent elsewhere in the future, likely in the same general area.","unitReviewedId":1305170},"6402":{"headline":"Sketchy Neighborhood","id":6402,"rating":2,"review":"My wife, infant son, younger brother and I stayed in this apartment at the end of March 2011 for spring break.  After spending five nights there I do not recommend it to anyone.    I had high hopes due to the open communication I had with the property owner before hand.  They were available to answer any questions I had.    My hopes were shattered as we stepped off the subway station into a rundown, ghetto Brooklyn slum.  I have lived around people of all ethnic and national backgrounds and have no problem mingling with people of color.  However, we received several warnings that \"white people\" need to be really careful in this neighborhood.  The description of the apartment said it was \"minutes from Manhattan.\"  Technically they are right in saying so although a more accurate description would have been \"45 minutes from Manhattan\".  We were excited about having a kitchen and saving some money eating in.  This didn't happen.  When in Manhattan we were so far from our apartment that we never went back during the day.    The apartment was a good size.  The sleeping arrangements were terrible.  The mattresses were honestly the worst i have ever slept on.  I couldn't help thinking of all the people in prison and envying their beds.    When it came time to check out we wanted to get an early start and make the most of our last day.  This was impossible because I couldn't get in touch with the owner, the manager, or the super despite repeated phone calls and voicemail messages.  We had no instructions so we sat and rotted until the super came over 4 hours later.    I felt the cleanliness was acceptable but the internet didn't work and they wouldn't fix it.

If you are looking for an average beach house......this is the place for you. If you are looking for upscale.......you might like the place next door - very nice villas.","unitReviewedId":1433800},"7930":{"headline":"Disapointment","id":7930,"rating":2,"review":"Los Tulipanes is an OK house.  I did not pay the full price, thank-goodness, as it is truly not worth it.  The beach at Soliman bay is weedy, full of sea grass and the bay has  a lot of trash, on the beach and everywhere else too.  The snorkeling is very mediocre at best, very little reef and few fish.  The road is very noisy, with motorcycles starting at 5 am.  The security is a bit of a scam, but there are a couple of very uninterested guards at the road entrance.    The house itself does not live up  to what is listed as amenities,.  The air conditioning does not work.  There is no washer and dryer. The oven does not work.  The grill is a joke, a dirty one at that.  There is no one site caretaker and getting things is a bit of a pain.  The housekeeper took 3 + hours a day to clean, which was a bit intrusive.  There is no useable music collection  and nothing decent to play music on.  Over all Soliman Bay is extremely over priced and over rated. Not the place to go unless you just want a house.

With that said, we never once felt unsafe.  We left our cars parked at the house and called cabs to go to/from dinner and the casinos which worked out perfectly.  It's just a 5-10 minute drive to all casinos.  Twice we ordered delivery from Tony Baloney's (once for breakfast, once for lunch) which I highly recommend.

They even helped us when we had trouble getting the DVD to play and talked us through it over the phone. They had someone available if any problems arose and were just wonderful to work with.  At Captain Bridge you are out the door and in a few steps are on the beach. It makes it great for coming back from the beach for lunch or to put little ones down for a nap. The hose out back was a huge plus when you are having kids going in and out. The kitchen was beautiful. The hardwood floors were great. Perfect for families. The master bedroom was huge! We even put our pac-N-play in the room and still had plenty of room left over. The front 2nd floor deck was great for viewing the ocean with its huge chair.

The listing photos only tell half the story - this is a carefully curated collection of original artworks and antiques that fascinates and welcomes all at the same time. It was like stepping into someone's comfortable home at their personal invitation. We loved all the nooks and crannies - there is always somewhere to go with a glass of wine, a book, the guitar or your favorite conversationalist. We were instantly relaxed in the lush, hilly surroundings and look forward to coming back. Everything we needed was there and the beds were not just for decoration - they were super comfortable too! Our two children chirped like happy birds out on the porch swings and exploring in the garden. The view was delightful. This cabin sits just outside Leipers Fork - which is a truly  magical little spot. We spent a happy afternoon there perusing the refreshingly original small stores there, as well as spending time in nearby Franklin and Nashville - in fact, there was more to do than we had time for! There was a great sense of creative people following their passions which was very appealing. But back to the cabin: its a  perfect place for a romantic hideaway, but it also worked well with our two children, aged 8 and 5 - in fact, there is so much room for everyone that it even felt romantic with the kids in tow!

Reviewer Comments: I set this stay up last week.  I feel you should know we did not stay the entire time.  It had been over 18 months since we had been able to get away if only for the weekend and found this location on line since our favorite place is the coast.  The positives of the trip were the home is very nicely furnished and appears recently updated.  Nice view, all the needed amenities, and had a quiet very relaxing afternoon and evening on Friday, which was our intended goal after crazy schedules and no time away.   Now the negatives.  About 2:00 Saturday afternoon the guests showed up for the other side.  Not hard to know since they consisted of 8 or 9 people including I think 5 children.  Obviously kids will be kids running, screaming, around inside and out, on the deck peering in thru the our windows, etc.  After 2 hours of this, we gave up.  It obviously was not going to get any better.  They literally sounded like they were in our unit, no difference.  We unwantingly could hear thru the walls exactly the intended schedules for the next day which was to start at 6:00AM.  This with our TV on to mask the noise.  Honestly it was ridiculous and we courteously made our feelings known.  Knowing the chance that the others and 4 or 5 kids cared little about our need and desires for the relaxing weekend we waited so long for, we packed up and came home.    The accommodations were nice but I would never stay again unless I was rented both sides within the family.  And to be honest had we been told there was a family showing up on Saturday I would not have reserved this in the first place.   We're married people with kids and not unaccustomed to how they can be controlled.  We used half a dozen utensils and caused nothing to be cleaned, dirt, sand, or otherwise.     I feel we're due half our rental.  The first day was wonderful, the second afternoon was ridiculous.     A couple of items that should be addressed.

The property listing and photos accurately described the rental, the property was clean and well maintained, the owner was very helpful, and I would recommend this property to friends and relatives.  The bathrooms at the Villa were functional and when they are updated from the '60, this Villa will become outstanding.      We spent our mornings and evenings sitting outside on a beautiful balcony surrounded by gorgeous tropical gardens.  During the day we traveled through the mountains to Rincon for a beautiful lunch at the Horned Dorset Primavera (highly recommend a visit without having to spend mucho dollars to stay at the facility), visited the Aricebo Observatory, and journeyed to Ponce to see family.  The town of Adjuntas is very beautiful as well.  We then left Villa Mary and stayed in El Convento in Old San Juan.  We played in the ocean and pool, had wonderful meals, and departed for home smiling and content.    Villa Mary is comfortable and safe.  The island has been hit hard by the global economic crisis with high unemployment, so as with anywhere in this world, be aware of the circumstances.  Knowing the island very well, we did feel very safe and were safe in this secluded historic villa.  Upon arrival, read some of the writings in the Villa Mary journal.

The house just evokes a relaxing atmosphere.  Situated oceanfront,  it is a dream to wake up every morning and watch the surfers while enjoying your morning coffee. The sounds of the waves are so soothing.  We got to watch the sea turtles hanging out a few afternoons while we were enjoying a glass of wine & getting the bbq ready.  The kids enjoyed playing in the waves.  If you have never snorkeled, there is a reef off to  the right that is great for first timers. Also, Sharks Cove is just up the road. I would recommend purchasing sand shoes if you are going to Sharks Cove.   Good sized grocery stores in both Hale'iwa and Waimea Bay for all your needs.  Don't forget to stop and try the shrimp trucks.  Ted's Bakery at Waimea Bay has the best Chocolate Haupia Pie. I highly recommend trying it.(if you like chocolate cream pie with a coconut cream filling & whipped cream). I read an article that it brings tears to the locals eyes when they talk about it. The absolute greatest thing about the north shore is the relaxed atmosphere. No high stress here. If you really miss the city you are really only about 30-40 mins. drive to Pearl City and the Honolulu concrete jungle. I would recommend this property to anymore who wants to \"really get away\" from it all.   Pizza take out the last night was great.  Hit the farmers market on Sunday morning.  It is small & the merchants are very friendly; offers lots of fresh produce. Some jewelry is also there.  We did try a Mexican restaurant located off the main street where we dined outside.

However, I would not recommend this specific rental for a few reasons:  1. There are some odd stains on the bathroom wall. If I could attach pictures, I would, but let’s just leave it at they were unsightly and unexpected. 2. 4 out of the 13 light bulbs in the room including the shower, balcony lights and nightstand lamps were dead, and I did find one replacement bulb above the microwave – which was also dead. 3. The television remote is held together using a Band-Aid. (Again, if I could attach pictures, I would, but I would say that this did not add to the romance of our vacation). 4. There is no cleaning done by the staff at all. While the listing doesn’t mention that there would be cleaning it also didn’t say that there wouldn’t be.  My assumption was that since this property is on resort site and the owner said that \"all services/amenities are included just as if I rented straight through the resort itself\" I assumed they would still come in to make the bed and replace towels at a minimum, but that is not something that is included in this unit’s services, as I had expected.  After emailing with the owner, he was quite unsympathetic and suggested that these issues were not his fault and I should have contacted his property manager (not the resort) to handle the problems.  Needless to say that dealing with property issues was not on my honeymoon itinerary.  In conclusion, Turks and Caicos is great. Grace Bay is great.  The Alexandra Resort is great, but this property, ALEX3303, is not the best...and what could have been taken care of by the owner in a very simple manner starting with an apology was not.

For 1 month we had 1 fitted sheet and 2 pillowcases for use on a hard urine stained bed.   All the linens, etc. were shabby/worn.    We spent the 1st day cleaning the flat. The shower was covered in mold, bathroom was dirty, floors hadn’t been vacuumed, walls/windows were dirty, dusty.   There was no toilet paper, trash bags, paper towels, napkins or cleaning supplies so we had to go out immediately to purchase all these.  We were also told we were required to clean the apartment before we checked out so it would be ready for the next guests.  The flat manager came & checked it before we left.  We left the apartment 100 x's cleaner than when we checked in.  If you are going to require us to clean the flat, there should be cleaning supplies supplied.     There were some huge issues that were not disclosed to us & we wouldn’t have rented the flat if we had known.    1.  It sits directly above a bar and there is no insulation between the floors.  They had live bands or music until 2 am Wed-Sat.  It was advertised as a quite location and was quite the contrary.  Also, the bar patrons would stand under the living room & smoke & the smoke constantly filled the apartment.     2.  There is a horrid stench of SEWER coming up the pipes in bathroom.  We did complain and were told they were aware of it but was too expensive to fix. It was so bad, we would sometimes gag going into the bathroom.      3.  The entire shower is made of glass block; the walls of the bathroom are also glass block.  You can see the person taking their shower & using the toilet from the \"office\" area, hallway and kitchen.  Not at all private.    Some of the pros.    The location is the best in Paris.  For me it was the saving grace of the apartment.   The floor plan and space.  It is quite large by Parisian standards. It had tons of storage. The owner spoke English & was helpful w/ most situations & waived the electricity.","unitReviewedId":1330738},"8572":{"headline":"Misleading description and poorly maintained","id":8572,"rating":1,"review":"We decided to book the property because of all the good reviews, but were very disappointed & raised the following issues with the owner.  The barn is situated in the corner of the owner’s garden, sharing the garden and has an unfenced pond. The paddock is a piece of land above the property with a 20 foot drop to the garden below. None of this was mentioned in the description.  The heating was inadequate and inefficient, 3 old panel heaters, 1 modern heater and 1 small fan heater. The night storage in the photo has been disconnected. This  meant the mornings were very cold.  The kitchen had 5 appliances plugged into one socket even though the information folder warns of the electrics tripping easily. The heaters had to be switched off to ensure the electric shower ran hot.  The washing machine knob was faulty and did not turn correctly, the microwave timer was faulty, the fridge did not even have a freezer compartment and the casing was broken.  The bathroom had a walk in shower but the door opened alongside the basin so only giving a space of 10.5 inches to squeeze through and enter.  The bedside light was broken and no alternative was offered.  The owner admitted cleaning the barn himself, 2 old soap bars remained from previous lets, the mugs were dirty, and the smoke alarm battery had been disconnected.

Also, the description states that there are 4 Queen size bedrooms, which is not true – only 1 upstairs has a Queen size bed, three others are Full size.

Second, the cleaning person does a very poor job cleaning the house. Some of the bed sheets were not clean, one had even some kind of blood stains and another had hairs all over. The impression was that they were just folded from the previous tenants. Luckily, we had our own sheets. The refrigerator was very dirty with a lot of old food items. We had to clean it to store our own food. BTW, the tenants are being charged $125 cleaning fee.

The courtyard or garden was nice, the pool was very well taken care and cleaned. The owner and the \"house manager\" are quite understanding and nice persons. The place (Pernera, Protaras) seems to be especially silent (and closed) outside the season, but You get used to that and if You have a car it does not harm, because then You have every chance to go to more lively places (for ex. Paralimni for shopping and Agia Napa for rastaurants, open market etc.). In additon there is also available quite well working public transportation (busses) and stops are close to the Villa. Especilally the British have various kind of  happenings (charity etc.) also during \"winter time\". So taken these into consideration we could recommend the Villa St Mary also to persons (retired for example) wanting to stay long there outside the season.    During our long stay (3 months) we met also things, which we didn´t like. When arriving the Villa was not so clean as we expected it to be. It was cleaned, but the basic housecleaning might have been neglected for a long time. So we cleaned and washed places etc. more than we understood it would due to us.

Healthy individuals should have no problem, even our Lab figured it out on his own within 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, there were two issues that detracted from our visit.  First, the unit has several minor issues in need of repair and/or maintenance and the cleaning was not at all thorough (floors not mopped and mold in the shower).   Second, shortly after we left, we received the following email:  \"I hope you enjoyed your stay... Unfortunately, due the the extreme amount of dog hair left by your stay (found on counters, in the beds, all over the couch), we are going to have to invoice you for the extra cleaning that will have to be done to the house.

I replied with a curt email detailing the fact that I had paid the \"pet fee\" and further listing the issues within the unit that needed repair (I should also point out, at no time did I use profanity in my email reply). I received a rebuttal from the owner that included the following statements (edited for PG rating):   \"I can see that you are kind of a d---.\" \"I'll chalk the extra cleaning up to bad choice in tenants.

The view is to die for and the drive to the villa is fairly easy once you get used to it.   But there are a few things missing at the villa that make no sense.    Starting with the most troubling - the lack of privacy in the second bedroom.  The villa is built in 2 pods withe the second bedroom across the courtyard from the pool.  The sliding glass door that faces the courtyard (and therefore the rest of the property) is mirrored slightly.  But in the evening, with lights on in the bedroom, one can see right in to the bedroom - no privacy whatsoever.  I can't imagine sharing with another couple under these conditions.  There is internet but it is hardwired.  Thus only one person a a time can access it - by plugging their computer into the connection.  When a wireless system costs about $100 it makes no sense at this price point to make it this difficult.  Lastly the kitchen seems that it was outfitted in one day, without a lot of thought. As an example we decided to make corn bread one day - but guess what?  No pan - no measuring cups - no measuring spoons.  And there are other small missing items that would take only a few dollars to provide but would be nice - it's the tropics how about a hand juicer for the limes?  Be aware that the TV package selected by the owner is very basic.  We spent some time trying to watch fairly basic channels like MSNBC - not part of the \"subscription\".  The villa is well located, the beds are comfortable, the outdoor shower is great.

Under the sofa, there was a collection of fuzz and dirt, which I cleaned up.  The place smelled, especially the bathroom, my husband would not even shower in there, water sprayed all over, as you could not regulate the flow of water.  When I showered, I was always standing in 2 to 3 inches of water, as the drain could not take it away as fast as it came out of the shower head.  The building is very old, with a very dangerous staircase leading to the second floor.  The suite below is vacant, the roof leaks and the paper or wallboard is peeling off, the place should be condemned.  The swimming pool is likely not very sanitary, the grounds are poorly maintained.  The rent is double what it should be and the landlord tries to keep as much of the damage deposit as he can, for no damages.  Not recommended unless you want to stay in a dump and have money to throw away on a miserable holiday.

The back gate is broken with rusty nails protruding in several places, and there were no supplies when we ran out of TP and several light bulbs were burned out, again with no replacements provided anywhere.

We stayed here because of the easy access to the Russian Turkish Baths & pool.  But the pool was also under construction and off limits.  When we mentioned the pool being closed to the owner upon arrival he said, oh it was supposed to be done, and it will be in about a week, but others working in the building (both at the front desk and the baths) said it was more like a couple months away from completion.  The beach access was down another dingy dirty hallway... very embarrassed to invite friends and family here and that was our original intent, ie. lunch by the pool,etc.  When we did go to the beach, the remodel contractors were actually sandblasting the back of the the building to redo balconies and it was loud and quite disturbing.

It was not as it was presented, in that it was much smaller than expected, and as it is on the 2nd floor, the main window/doors to balcony face a stucco wall-- that is your view.  The kitchen utensils & appliances were old and very used, and the bathroom tiles on the wall fell off on their own. The owners implied I was the one to cause their fall.  They also are very inquisitive as to your business in Buenos Aires that is not normally asked when renting a vacation rental.  I was traveling with my 10 month old daughter and I asked if we could move the glass table in the living room for her safety. They flatly told the caretaker to not move a thing.  Bottom line is this is the owners' main apartment, so you are treated as if you are trespassing for the time you are there.  Their precious apartment is not even nicely furnished or decorated!  After several days' stay I asked for my money back, and they agreed to 1 month but refused to give back a penny more.  I was forced to spend most of that one month away from Buenos Aires just to be out of the apartment-- and in the end, they even told me I had to leave one day earlier than my contract stated or else they would charge me.  It was an awful experience that thankfully still has not turned me off of renting other vacation rentals throughout the remainder of our stay in South America-- but unfortunately it was a bad introduction to the Argentine people.

It is just unfortunate that the review was not posted until we had already paid for the condo in full.  If I had known what this condo was really like prior to renting it, I would have gone elsewhere.  This condo is old, hasn’t been updated in many years if ever, and is not well maintained.  The description that was posted when I rented the condo was extremely inaccurate.  In fact I contacted the owners to let them know about all the discrepancies between their description and the actual condo and they have since updated their posting.  Here are some of the discrepancies that I wrote the owners about:  • DESCRIPTION:  “extremely spotless” & “PRISTINE . . SPOTLESS . .”   FACT:  The condo is anything but spotless.  The light and fan fixtures have an inch of dust on them, the carpets are  filthy, the oven was dirty, there is food splashed on the kitchen backsplash, the living room couch is dirty with spots, and the bathroom tub is grimy.  • DESCRIPTION:   “absolutely no noise”   FACT:  The road noise is so loud that it kept us awake several nights.  • DESCRIPTION:   “very upscale” and “beautifully decorated”   FACT:  It may have been beautifully furnished in 1970 but not in 2011.  EVERYTHING needs updated.  • DESCRIPTION:   “sets of 48 dishes, utensils, etc.”    FACT:  There was a cupboard full of mismatched dishes.  •  DESCRIPTION:   “plush satin comforter” in the master bedroom   FACT:  There is a satin comforter, however, it is ripped and dirty.  • DESCRIPTION:  “screened private lanai”   FACT:  This is correct, however, it doesn’t tell you that the screen is ripped and lets bugs in.  • DESCRIPTION:  “unobstructed views” and “one of the best views”   FACT:  The views are unobstructed if you want to look at the condo building in front of Building A.  • DESCRIPTION:  “electric grill”   FACT:  There was no grill, only a pile of old moldy chairs, and pool noodles in the corner of the lanai.  • DESCRIPTION:  “bed linens, beach towels, and PLUSH towels”   FACT:  These items are available but they are not plush.  I have never seen such thin sheets as the ones that were on the master bed.  Again all of these items are probably at least 20 years old.  • FACT:   The smoke detectors don’t work.  In fact, they aren’t even hooked up which I’m sure is a violation of state law.     If you are considering renting this unit please look elsewhere.  There are much nicer units available for a lot less money.

The view is very good and the flat is clean but unless you're a dwarf, or are prepared to put up with the inconvenience, then really consider staying somehwere else.

We had entered the cabin with trash still in the cans, wet towels piled in the shower, the bed used and unmade, etc. The maid did eventually come to the cabin and clean, but again that should have already been taken care of. The hot tub was also insufficiently working, the water never got above “luke warm” temperature which was slightly disappointing. It was not these small occurrences that were the problem with our stay, it was the way everything was handled.

When at the beach or the pool I insist on having a steady supply of clean, dry towels so it was wonderful to have the laundry right in the kitchen. Owner supplied the soap too!  After a long day in the sun it's nice to have a tall, cool drink so the ice maker in the freezer was really a pleasure to have. There are very quiet ceiling fans throughout the condo and the colorful beach motif helps to set the holiday mood.  It's only about a 150 yard walk to the beach which is where we spent the vast majority of our time.  The owner provided the large Coleman cooler on wheels (very welcome indeed) as well as beach furniture.  After getting pounded in the surf, cool cocktails poolside were a great way to enjoy the evening. The pool is 3 to 6 feet deep, very clean ( I personally saw the pool cleaning crew twice in the very early AM) and spacious. Poolside furniture was plentiful and clean and the deck was spacious as well. The other guests were cordial and polite.  This section of Beach Boulavard is only 2 lanes wide as opposed to four, resulting in reduced traffic and traffic noise and making for a safe, easy and short walk to the beach.  The touristy nightlife is a mile or more to the east.  Grocery store, liquor store, pharmacy are all a one to two minute drive away.  For Sunday Mass, Our Lady of the Gulf Catholic Church is a 7-10 minute drive away at 2nd street and 22nd avenue.  It's off the beaten path and there are two casual restaurants in the mall across the street which are patronized by the locals.  Check them out.  All of the appliances in the condo work properly.

I had already told you that we had to clean the dirty dishes that were left from the previous renters. The coffee maker had dirty coffee still in the filter and carafe!!!! The refrigerator had to be cleaned thoroughly because it was left in terrible conditions. This is only the kitchen, and I have pictures to prove it. We do not like the heat to be on at a high temperature and we were there the weekend at a temperature of 60 degrees and believe me we did not freeze. The towels smelled terrible, we believed you did not even washed them and we had to wash them again. I spent one night cleaning and washing towels and sheets because they smell rotten. One of the queen beds was full of hair from NOT being cleaned!!! I wished I would have called you to see how really dirty the cabin was, but pictures will show this. I do not think you have the right to withhold my cleaning deposit since I did more cleaning than vacationing. The upstairs bathroom was cleaned by my daughter because the floor was so dirty and full of other renters hair!!!!! yuck!!! The towels underneath the bathroom cabinet were wet because of water dripping from the pipes, and we had to wash those towels too..... not to mention staying up late drying the wet towels that YOU left inside the dryer. The garage smelled like a dead cat was left there because of the garbage that your previous renters left. The garage was filthy!!!!! Why did you not go to throw this garbage yourself? Why would you even think I should do this? The fireplace was left with so many ashes that we had to make several trips to the garbage disposal to clean it and THEN be able to use it ourselves. I am demanding my cleaning deposit back or I will gather all the pictures and videos we took to send these to Paypal Resolution Center or vrbo resolution center. When You advertise a cabin and advertise it to be clean do so.... and you did not do this.... You are responsible for renting me a clean cabin and you did not do so.

When we arrived the Chalet wasnt very clean. The floors were very dirty and there was dog hair EVERYWHERE. However, I was able to clean that up. Also, the biggest bedroom downstairs did not have clean covers on them. When I pulled the sheets back there were hairs and dirt all in the bed. I had to take the covers off and wash them. All the other beds had clean covers. The washer and dryer came in very handy but was very hard to access due to the doors infront of them. There were only 2 rolls of toilet paper in the house. We had 8 guest and stayed 5 days. That was not enough so we had to buy toilet paper and paper towels. Besides those things the Honey Bear was nice. The location was pretty awesome. Right near the trolly stop. I would consider renting the Honey Bear again if I was promised next time the blankets on all beds were clean and there was not pet hair everywhere. Overall I liked it.

It looked much better than the pictures and the location was perfect. Only a 3-5 minute walk to the beach and also within walking distance to bars or a short inexpensive cab ride. Everything was peachy until we started using the place. When we pulled out dishes to use, most of them were filthy! We had to hand wash pretty much every plate in there and some of the cups were also dirty as well. I would recommend bringing your own dishwasher soap since the one in there was harder than a rock and obviously did not do the job in the dishwasher. There was sand all over the floors when we first got there which we did not mind, its a beach house next to the beach its gonna happen but there was also sand in one of the queen beds. There was white stuff on one of the comforters on a queen bed and we elected not to use it since we had no idea what was on the comforter! The water pressure was not fixed like it was said in a different review because we were worried about the water pressure as well since there were 7 of us. Took a while to get us all showered and ready. Hopefully the water pressure will improve for your trip. Be cautious about the deposit situation. There is a \"cleaning lady\" who comes in and cleans the beach pad and also the other house the owner owns, then reports back to the owner about the shape of the house and then the owner makes the decision on the deposit. Obviously the cleaner cannot be that good if there was sand all of and it was dirty when we arrived! The inspection of the place should probably come from the owner herself right after the guest check out so there is no question to how the place was left!

However, the advertisement is very misleading. First, the apartment is not on the first floor. By European standards this would be the second floor in America. The apartment is on the 3rd floor, or 4th floor American. The ad claims that it is suitable for the elderly and infirmed. Not true. The ad clearly states that a small discount is given for stays longer than 4 nights and we were there for 5 nights with no discount. When we asked about the discount we were told that it was for 7 nights or more. We decided that it wasn't worth arguing over a small discount. Next the ad says that all utilities are included. We were informed that heat would be an additonal 5 euros a day. When we questioned this we were told that unlike America, Italy cares about the enviorment and doesn't have nuclear power, so their utilities are more expensive. Not true, but even so, just say in the ad the utilities are extra. But the greatest disappointment was that we followed the deposit intructions to the letter, but then were told that our deposit was 41 euros short. The first explanation was that our bank had charged a fee for the wire transfer, but when we showed the document that clearly stated that they charged us the fee separately, the explanation was that our bank used a \"middle man\" bank that had charged a fee. When I showed documentation that the transfer went directly into the owner's account the explanation became that a euro in America isn't the same as a euro in Italy. We explained that we also made a wire transfer for the apartment that we had rented in Rome, which is also in Italy, and there was no problem. The end result was that the owner still insisted that the euro in Italy is different and not the same value as a euro in America. Ludicrous. We were already there by this time and either had to eat the extra 41 euros or the entire deposit and go elsewhere. The next surprise during our stay was when my husband had gone out while I took a shower. Imagine my surprise when I opened the bathroom door and found two men standing in the room. Neither could speak English, but I could figure out that they were there to fix something with the TV, which was working fine. I understand that owners have the right to come in and fix things that are broken, but it was obvious that someone was in the shower and alone. They should have come back later. Will not rent from this owner again.

This becomes apparent when you see notices on the walls threatening large fines if you even move the furniture.    If you're taking both properties there could be up to 22 of you. If you eat together or have a drink altogether in one of the houses their is bound to be a certain amount of wear. This is not taken into account by the owners even though they happily accept your large booking and suggest people socialise in just one of the houses.    They charged us 250 Euros for a replacement tv stand. I was not aware that we'd broken one. On top of this we were chaged    €34     mileage for trip to grenoble to purchase tv table and coffee machine, 62 miles at .55/mile  €45     3 hours grenoble trip  €250    labour, assemble tv table, dismantle and remove old one, painting    We were never provided with any evidence of the broken tv stand or offered any receipts. I did not pursue them for them for this as we were told 'further correspondence will result in an Adminstration Charge of £50'.    In total they deducted 773 Euros. There was big group of us and I would have expected to pay a bit extra but certainly not that much. We did clean the place before we left and we did pay for cleaners as part of the booking.    The accomadation itself is good but I've given a poor rating for the amount of security deposit they took. We were there for just a weekend.

The home well equipped with bedding, towels, kitchen appliances, and Washer/Dryer. The bathroom's were in each of the 2 bedrooms which is fine until you have more than 4 people which makes it a bit odd opening a bedroom door to get to a bathroom.     The pool and hot tub were very nice as well as heated. It takes a little effort to figure out how to make the hot tub hot (use the book with pictures).   The view was great looking north however we could not see the sunset even from the end of the dock during the Month of March.     There was a very friendly cat that seemed to be a resident of the property. It meowed a lot until we offered it some food.    The waterfront was less desirable as there was a massive amount of sea grass you had to trudge through to get a kayak or canoe in the water. The worst by far was the horrible smell from the rotting sea grass which most resembled the smell of horse manure. As long as the wind blew out it was fine.     This is the third time in 3 years we have rented homes in different parts of the keys. I would say this was the least desirable compared to ocean side in Ramrod Key near Big Pine followed by Stock Island just north of Key West.     I did like the pool, hot tub, use of Kayak's and big screened in porch.   If I owned this property I would fix the sea grass problem with a sea wall like some of the neighbors have.

The master bedroom opens to the kitchen, and the other 2 bedrooms have access to the kitchen either through the master bedroom or they have to go outside and come in through the kitchen doors, it was a little in convenient.  this is a 'working ranch' and there were workers around the house for most of the stay.  they did ask us after we voiced our concern about the workers, if they could continue to work, and we did allow them to continue working.

I settled on this 2 bedroom duplex because of the location and the price.  We were not disappointed.    It is in a very secure, safe development populated mostly by year-round French residents of the island.  All the units back up to the beach, and there are always kids and families playing, making for a wonderful and safe family atmosphere.  Security guards regularly patrol.  It is a great location for exploring the various beaches of the island.  The pictures on the site show the unit and the back porch exactly as it is.  It is truly a relaxing place to spend a week.  Positives -   Owner is very helpful, responsive and friendly.  Representative met me at the unit even though we arrived late in the evening.  Price is good compared to other units advertised on this and other sites.  Safe with friendly neighbors.  Quite clean, with air conditioning, wifi and kitchen.  Wonderful back porch opening to sand and pool.  Couch opens to a bed for extra sleeping space.  2 bathrooms and showers.  Perfect for a family with children as children can explore the area while you watch from the porch.  Location close to at least 4 great restaurants and a bakery, mere minutes from Baie Rouge.    Negatives -   There is some broken glass in the sand out back and you cannot swim in the beach due to sea urchins.  (You will probably explore other beaches.)  Pool could use a little bit of upkeep.  Kitchen is sort of small for any serious cooking needs.  (You will probably eat out a lot.)   Overall, great place.  Make sure you check out Les Boucaniers for dinner.  Do not go to the French Gourmet grocery nearby unless you just want to buy wine or an emergency item - prices are drastically inflated.  Go to Dutch side for groceries and French side for wine, cheese, bread and specialties.  Skip the marina in Marigot, but definitely go eat in Grand Case.

There was a definite need for more caserole dishes as people staying here definitely prepare most of their meals in. We also had to request service for the ceiling fan in the living area which was not working and had to be replaced. The chair on the small patio off the master bedroom was rusted beyond use.

It has armband access security which, while not foolproof, at least kept crowds from entering the property who were not guests.  They also made a great effort to clean the common area and grounds continuously, which is a must especially during Spring Break when so many unattended teenagers are there.    This particular unit was spacious and featured 2 comfortable beds, a very nice sectional sofa and flat screen tv.  However, it was not clean and it was definitely low on amenities.  While there, I requested that the floors be cleaned - gray tile with ivory grout near the edges had black grout in all the traffic patterns (yuck). And yes, a very nice maintenance man came to clean, said that he would sanitize it, but couldn't get black grout to be ivory again. The frieze carpet in the living room and guest rooms was an oatmeal color, was dirty and had numerous discolorations due to past stains - - definitely needed to be steam cleaned.    The master bedroom and guest room comforters were stained and there were no pillow shams.  They replaced the master bedroom comforter with a new one with shams on request.  The other was passable (the stain looked to be a faint bleach spot) so I didn't request a change to that one.  We had no hairdryers in the bathrooms, no clocks in the bedrooms, no area rugs, very little decoration, threadbare sheets, no drapes (blinds only) and a marginally-equipped kitchen - not even a dustpan or a pitcher.  These are things that I thought should be standard for a nice property and at this price point.    This unit is very close to the elevator and stairs, so it can be a bit noisy.  I'm a fairly light sleeper and eventually got used to it.  I have to say that with a good steam-cleaning and very little money for the missing items mentioned above, I think that this could be a VERY nice unit.    I twice attempted to make contact with the management company (by voicemail and email) before leaving this review, but received no call backs or return emails.  I thought that with such competition in the rental marketplace that they would want to hear constructive feedback and attempt to resolve it to satisfaction.

Once realising the problem he called an electrician out who came immediately and fixed the problem. The last power cut happened  on our last night- when we were busy using the washing machine,packing and generally preparing ourselves for our journey home. This lasted all night. We had to take soaking wet clothes out of the washing machine and wrap them up before packing them.  The pool is not very big. Each time we used it, it was very noisy due to the generator keeping the pool clean. However, the last 4 days of our holiday the pool was closed for cleaning. It would have been useful to have a toilet close by rather than having to go back up to your appartment.  We would not recommend this property to anyone.  We enjoyed going out on the bus to the other resorts where there were good restaurants, shops and interesting stalls.  One of the attractions we enjoyed was a day on a boat to observe the Dolphins and Birds on the river with an enjoyable lunch.","unitReviewedId":1416646},"1844":{"headline":"A Great time with friends","id":1844,"rating":5,"review":"We went here  a group of 5 mates wanting to play some golf but also relax and go to the beach's  bars and restaurants.

If anything, the photos on the website don't do the apartment or its' views justice.

There were wasps and nests on the porch (they did have spray on the porch).  Inside it is cozy and well stocked, but the spider webs everywhere were creepy.  They were under each of the dining room chairs, under the bathroom cabinets, next to the microwave and in every corner.  The rest of the place was clean, the floors and bathroom were clean and the linens and towels were clean. The property is nice for kids to run around, it has a nice sandy beach area.  We didn't get in the river as it was very mossy and had strong currents, but if you are the adventurous type you definately could.    Although you pay a cleaning fee you are expected to wash and put away all dishes and take the trash can out to the curb when you leave.  We weren't sure if the food in the fridge and freezer were the family who owns the cabin, or if people left it there for future use, that was a little confusing.  Nothing is dated or labelled in any way.    All in all it is a good value for the price and we didn't have any trouble figuring out the locks and combinations, which I was worried about beforehand.  The cabin only sleeps about 5, but if you had a family group that wanted to camp the property is huge so you could pitch as many tents as you wanted.  There is only one bathroom though.

The t.v. in the bedroom had no cable and was even smaller.  The noise from the people renting the other rooms was very disturbing.  The location is good and close to the slopes you just have to go up and down the hill from the cabin. I would recommend spending a little more to get a better cabin.

The photos that accompany the listing are NOT photos of the actual flat. They give you the impression of space that simply doesn't exist. The problems with this flat are several: 1) the size is tiny. From one end of the main room to the other is only about 10 paces. That in itself wouldn't be the issue if, as mentioned, they hadn't misrepresented the space through their photos; 2) they claim the space would sleep four adults, but the sofa bed is an undersized futon, which is barely big enough for two small children, never mind teens or adults; 3) they claim it has meal seating for four, but only came with three chairs; 4) the shower didn't drain properly, meaning you had about a minute before the basin would come close to overflowing; 5) we had to ask for the maid service to come because our trash was overflowing the one small waste basket that was provided. Also, our weather was unusually warm, but you can't really open the windows at night because you're situated right off of Kensington Road, which meant traffic noise was loud. Even a small fan would have helped. They also list that the flat comes with an oven and coffee maker, neither of which is true. There is a two ring cooktop and a microwave. We bought coffee and filters, which was a waste since there's no coffee maker. Lastly, there is no staff on site, so if you have a problem, you're only recourse is to call or e-mail the booking office. We had to figure out the TV on our own because the agent who met us was no help.   The one huge positive about this flat is the location, right across from Kensington Gardens and a five minute walk from the Kensington High Street Tube stop. So, you're basically paying a lot for the location, because the amenities to the property itself are clearly misrepresented.

There is no living room, but a rather small kitchen with a table hardly enough to seat four, which makes socializing in the evening a bit of a problem. Also, there is only one small tv in the kitchen. However, two bedrooms and two bathrooms make the apartment attractive for a family of four or two couples. The location is absolutely fantastic, though.  A lot of restaurants in the neighborhood, a small grocery shop nearby, and a larger one on the main street.  And, all the main sights are within a walking distance, just across the river. So I'd say the price is also ok, considering that most of the hotels charge outrageous amounts of money in peak periods like Easter. I'd suggest to the owner to make sure there is at least some oil, sugar, salt, and basic seasoning so visitors don't have to buy those, which are usually not available in small quantities.","unitReviewedId":1443729},"2594":{"headline":"Williams Vacation Home","id":2594,"rating":4,"review":"We stayed 3 nights at this cute home.

We used it as a home base to visit the Grand Canyon, Meteorite Crater, Petrified Forest & Painted Desert.

(appr. 3 times larger) in 5 min walk distance for the price of just 20 EUR higher, though these apartments even can't be compared!  The reason this aprt was chosen by me was the announced free tel connection to regular lines within Europe and it was reconfirmed with Greg (host) that my country is in the list. Still having arrived I found out that there is no such connection (which I really needed and planned my trip based on its availability), Greg didn't turn to be helpful with it. Worth mentioning that we didn't see him at all, had only his tel. numbers left in the aprt. though 2 of them were mobiles which again couldn't be reached from aprt. telephone, and on the regular line he was usually unavailable. Also there is no photo of bath/toilette on the site and only upon arrival I could understand why - it is the worst place of the part. - a bit larger than 1 sq.m and you can hardly turn around there.

The beds and pillows were very comfortable. --The owners are exceedingly gracious and helpful, and they made themselves readily available when we had questions. --We were here during a winter snowstorm. This meant we had some digging out to do in terms of snow, and we needed to keep the two fireplaces regularly stoked with the plentiful wood supplied by the owners. We're area residents and thus fully expected this, but if you're not familiar with alpine winters, you might not know to anticipate this. --The road up to the home is fairly steep. The owners provide a Rhino for transportation, and it's slow in the snow. Depending upon the number in your party and amount of gear, it may require more than one trip in the Rhino to get you settled in.  --Getting back and forth into Silverton from the home is not quick, especially in the wintertime. Once we got settled into the cabin, we mostly stayed put, especially given the storm. Come prepared, with plenty of your favorite food and drink. A cabinet is well-supplied with a variety of board games. --The kitchen is well-equipped; the one thing we would have liked to have had included was a microwave oven.  If you love to XC ski or snowshoe at higher altitude, this is a great place for that. I think summer and fall hiking would be fantastic.

The owner was helpful when we were considering renting several properties and had not yet made a decision. The service level dropped off drastically as soon as the rental was paid in full in advance of our arrival. When we showed up at the property, the staff was completely uninformed of our rental period and the fact that our wedding was to occur on site days later, despite the fact that we booked the venue over 6 months in advance and paid $4000. The grass was uncut and full of weeds; there was a gaping hole in the living room ceiling; there was water damage in several rooms; the house smelled moldy. The couches were torn. The linens were old and rough. There was wood rot in at least one room, such that you could clearly see outside from inside in an area that was not intended for such exposure. The water does not heat up; expect lukewarm baths at best. All of this 2 days prior to my future in laws who were visiting Jamaica for the first time were expected to stay in the house. Needless to say it was a nightmare.  I wish I could upload all of the photographs that I took with my blackberry documenting this horrible experience.

Outside on the patio, someone had left out a garbage bag, a kitchen broiler pan, a saw, a paint roller & paint tin, and a cardboard box & plastic pail.  In addition, there were not enough towels or sheets for the number of confirmed guests.  The spare pillows had hair and something yellow on the pillow cases. Upon arrival (on a sunny afternoon), the house was pitch black inside.  All of the shutters were closed, so we had to stumble in the dark to find the windows & doors, to open the shutters.  Once the shutters on all 3 floors of the home were opened, it was much brighter, but the home has a musty smell.  The foyer, kitchen & living room have an overwhelming smell of oil, coming from the basement.  It smelled like a mechanic's shop/garage, and the smell never aired out during our stay. The home is decorated in a charming English style, and the amenities (kitchen, baths) were suitable, but because of the lack of cleanliness, the darkness, the smell, and the bugs, I would not recommend this house to anyone, especially not a friend or relative.","unitReviewedId":1435065},"6102":{"headline":"February rental in Port A","id":6102,"rating":2,"review":"The house rental was clean and comfortable during our stay.The house lacked outside chairs for the deck area and there was no ladder in the pool which made it difficult to use for a senior.

In fact there is no hot tub but rather a jaccuzzi which is at one end of the pool. Because there was no solar heating of the pool this too was not usable.  3) There is no question that the owners are generous in allowing use of everything in the house. And yes, the house is well equipped ('super-equipped' is an overstatement)with the following exceptions: no barbecue, lack of Internet connection and the dishwasher does not work well. However, in the bedrooms there is a shortage of space to store clothes, etc. due to insufficient drawer space but more importantly closet space. The closets in bedrooms 2 & 3 were totally unusable since there was no space to hang up clothes, etc. There was some space in the master bedroom closet but not enough for a month's stay. Similarly, in the kitchen there was no space in the drawers or cupboards to store any personal belongings.   4) The owners' taste is quite ornate with many knick knacks, etc. (This was not totally apparent from the pictures shown online.) If clutter bothers you, this is not the house for you.  5) 'on lakefront' is misleading. The house backs onto a community pond.

Disgusting fish tank in the family room; all green and gross (no dead fish, thank goodness).  Floor was very dirty; didn't look it but if you walked w/bare feet, they got black. Needs deep tile cleaning. Ceiling fan in kitchen was also grease and dirt coated; not attractive. The whole house needed deep cleaning; not just a wipe down.  Oven was broken and we were not told this ahead of time and bought things like pizzas and brownie mix.  We called, and got an apology but nothing could be done. Had to cook on BBQ; a challenge for frozen pizzas! We had a professional chef in our group and looked forward to cooking so this was a little inconvenient. The kitchen had a lot of dishes, etc, but no decent cooking things like pots and pans. For french toast one morning, we had to use an egg pan and cook one piece at a time. Spend a few bucks and buy some decent pans etc and throw out all the garbage (2 huge stock pots!! really??) And we couldn't get any hot water in the kitchen sink; we let it run forever to no avail.  It appeared that the smoke detectors were not working (hanging open, no batteries, maybe they were hard wired).  Biggest issue was the hot tub/pool.  You could not have the hot tub working if you wanted heat in the pool. Guests are not allowed to switch the between the two, so you basically had to choose which one you wanted to use for the length of your stay.

Thanks Donna...we hope to return some day!","unitReviewedId":1451468},"2585":{"headline":"Great Vacation with the Locals","id":2585,"rating":4,"review":"This property was a comfortable and fun way for our group of 3 couples to save money and stay in the Sorrento area like a local.  The pictures and listing are accurate.  I even thought the kitchen was bigger than I expected.  Each couple was comfortable in our own rooms and we share the 2 bathrooms.  The kitchen was well stocked.  The owner, Michele, was very helpful and addressed any issues (we didn't have hot water right away).  It was quiet (except for the rooster that the other 2 couples heard and we did not).  The apartment is in a beautiful area (the roof terrace has amazing views) surrounded by lemon groves.  It is a 10-15 minute uphill walk from the Sant'Agnello train station.  It is not a tough walk, but there are not pedestrian walkways the entire way, so be prepared to share the road with cars and scooters.  (From the train station, walk straight out toward the main road and turn left before crossing the main road. Look for the statue half way down the block and cross at the crosswalk to go right up the stairs of Via Maianiello.  At the end of that walkway you will pass a church and continue on the road uphill (no sidewalk).  After a few curves look for the tiny road on your left where a dance studio is, (Via Occulto) that leads directly to the house (#26 on the left).)  Sant'Agnello is one train stop (2-3 mins) from Sorrento.  Around the corner (exit the train station, immediately turn left one block to main road) is a supermarket and several small markets for groceries, snacks and fresh sandwiches.  The sandwiches are great to take for day trips to Pompeii (25 min train ride), Capri (ferry from Sorrento), the beach at Meta (25 minute bus ride from Sant'Agnello) or Amalfi/Positano (hour long bus ride from Sorrento).  Our favorite local meal (besides the fresh sandwiches) was at Hotel Alpha in Sant'Agnello. Our worst was at Inn Bufalito in Sorrento.  The pizza in Naples was worth the trip!  Remember to bring your own washcloths, toiletries and blow dryers (with appropriate converters).    Overall, we would definitely go back to La Terrazza. With a group, you can't stay any cheaper and enjoy living like a local anywhere else in the area!","unitReviewedId":1445709}},"145":{"2286":{"headline":"Great Spring Break Vacation for Family","id":2286,"rating":4,"review":"The listing was accurrate, home was decorated very nice, plenty of space inside and out.

There is no balcony, you can open the door and look out but you can not step on anything out side the door as it is under 2\".  There are not six restaurants, there are only two and one is open only for breakfast. The lamp in the room had a burn hole in it and a burn on the wall. Everything was dusty and the carpet and chair dirty. The beautiful comforter and pillows shown in the picture are not in this room, we had a standard hotel comforter.  There were dirty sheets shoved in the closet, drops of scented oil on the nightstand and desk glass so when I set something down it got oil on it.  If you want to sleep four you will have to do some fancy stacking of furniture in order to pull out the sofa bed.

The windows all had paint chipping off.  As they looked orginal, lead paint is an issue.  We have a young toddler where this is a pressing concern.  There were visible paint chips, some showing up in the carpet and near the windows even though they were wiped clean.  If we weren't so tired we would have left before sleeping.  At night space heaters were needed which I think dried the air along with dust.  We woke up at 1am not being able to breathe.  We opened the door and felt better, again ready to leave but too tired to drive home.  My toddler also woke up with bites all over his body--bed bugs?  I don't normally complain but this was not a cabin we enjoyed and would not return.  Please consider painting all old surfaces, esp. the windows for everybody's health.

Reviewer Comments: This was our 7th trip to Edisto. We usually go later in the summer so the beach was not very crowded and the water was pretty cold. We always stay inside the Wyndham resort but this was our first time staying at this property. The location was great, it is very close to the resort entrance and to the recreation center. The wireless internet in this property did not work properly and Atwood sent over another router but we never bothered to set it up - just plugged into ethernet directly which was a bit inconvenient for more than one computer. The Wyndham Beach Cabana was a mess - the outside showers were not working for our entire visit, so we had no way to rinse off the sand when we left the beach. There also were no chair and umbrella rentals. Most disturbingly, the water inside the women's restroom had been cutoff and the toilets were full of waste and backed up. I called three times and finally threatened to call the Dept. of Public health before Wyndham sent someone over to deal with the situation. We were also disappointed that the pool table had been removed from the recreation center, and it was even more disappointing that the arcade on Jungle Rd. had closed down. There is not much to do when you are tired of the beach, except riding bikes around the island was alot of fun. Edisto is very dog-friendly and our dog was able to run on the beach without a leash at this time of year, which was really nice. Our favorite restaurants were The Sea Cow and The Plantation inside Wyndham - highly recommend both. And stopping by Fontaine's on Docksite Rd. for fresh seafood right off the boat is the best!!! Overall this is a great vacation spot for families and dogs if you are looking for a quiet kid-friendly place to get away.   Manager responded on 4/15/2011: Dear Cynthia,Thank you for your review of 228 Linkside Villa.  We value your feedback.  Our goal is to provide you with an exellent vacation experience.

Reviewer Comments: We wish we knew this before we stayed here... The property and the location is stunning however after noticing a 'film' in the lava pools right in front of the property I did some investigating on the internet.  The film is fresh water mixing with salt water but the water is not so 'fresh' it seems there is a problem with raw sewage leaking from cesspools from the community and entering the lava pools.  I was appalled that the management or owners would not even give a warning to the guests as tests have been done showing elevated levels of bacteria caused by fecal matter.  Check it out yourself and Google \"Kapoho Tide Pools Sewage\". In my opinion this is a lawsuit waiting to happen as anyone with a cut is at risk of infection not to mention the disgusting factor.  If you do go we suggest snorkeling at high tide and walk along the lava to the outer pools where the snorkeling is better anyway, advice the owners should be mentioning in their welcome booklet at the house!! It is a shame that the community and regional officials have ignored this issue for the last 15 years (they have know about it for that long!) as this is one of the most beautiful locations on the island.

However, we couldn't find one pot or pan that was fit to cook a meal in.  They were all old, non-stick pots & pans that were so scratched up and chipped that we were afraid some of the nonstick material would wind up in our food.  I'm talking \"awful\".  We had brought a lot of food to cook at the cabin and much of it went to waste.  There wasn't even a usable can opener in the kitchen. And with the cabin being so isolated it's not like we could just run down the street to buy something.  You should be ashamed to charge the kind of money you charge for this cabin and not equip it properly.

Reviewer Comments: I'm a firm believer in preventative maintenance. Those who go cheap - fix things more than once. Upon our arrival, we were asked to relocate to another rental because the septic tank was backed up. About three hours later Kevin (property manager)  told us we could return to Shamrock (if we wanted) because the problem was resolved. (We were given a $100.00 gift card for the inconvenience). Unfortunately we went back that night (to avoid unpacking and repacking again) and the place smelled like sewage. The refrigerator and freezer appeared clean, but they smelled like spoiled fish (thank goodness for baking  soda, charcoal, and plug in air fresheners - purchased by us). By the third day the place was smelling better, but the garage door cable snapped and shot parts everywhere. Thank God no one was in the garage when it happened! On day five there was a significant storm and the skylight leaked. If you have back problems, the living room furniture will kill you. The refrigerator door handle was broken and needed replacing. I had to buy and replace several light bulbs. Only one working screen in the whole house, so air conditioning was used more than needed...and it wouldn't stay on temp for more than a couple hours. No list of domestic To-Do's like garbage day, pool maintenance, etc. or emergency phone numbers (fire, police, hospital, etc.). The master bathroom shower is pretty grungy .. and my wife refused to use it. The venetian blinds are tattered and need replacing. The entire house is tiled...and only five - very worn - 2X3 throw rugs were provided. Only 1 was non-skid...kinda dangerous). I ended up buying  much for the gift card. The house is located on a 90 degree curve on a very busy road, so exiting the driveway takes practice. The internet shuts down at random for hours at a time. The TV needed to be reprogrammed several times. Lawn maintenance and insect control leave something to be desired. The entire house could use a paint job.

Reviewer Comments: Don't Stay Here until the condo is updated and cleaned!  We rented a few times through this company and have been pleased.  However, this place was the worst!  Our family of 5 (2 adults and 3 older teenagers) stayed the week between Xmas and New Years 2010-11.  We choose the condo because of the number of beds it afforded.  It couldn't have been a worse choice!  The accommodations were in terrible shape.  Very, very dirty with a leaking roof and a light that threw off sparks when touched.  The linens and pillows were scratchy and old, probably from Good Will and the upstairs loft bed was so uncomfortable that we decided to leave a day early because we hardly slept the entire week.  I can deal with places that have not been updated but not with a place that is just plain dirty.  Cobwebs in the corners, lamps that you could write your name in the dust, etc.  This place needs a complete overhaul.  I would not recommend it until updated and cleaned.  I do, however, heartily commend the property manager Susan Scott for her gallant efforts in trying to make our family comfortable.

So the size is small, I can't imagine the lack of room there would be if the hidebed was out!!  My main problem was that there was an ant problem.

Reviewer Comments: This unit is a bit tired and should be updated or...  We have been visiting for about 10 years and have never had a real complaint.  This trip was not the best.  The 1st unit we were given didn't have the proper sleeping arrangement, so the kind and friendly office staff promptly moved us to the only other unit available. The unit we were moved to is a bit \"tired\" and should be updated or offered at a discount. Many of the basic cooking utensils were absent or unfit for use on a grill. The bed sheets were old and worn, and the bathroom and kitchen walls looked like they had been painted with a rag. We have been visiting for 10 years and this wasn't the best of our trips.    I realize it was busy season, but how many spring breaks have you been through?  Get some extra golf carts.   I waited 8 days(of an 11 day stay) for a cart, and yet everyday there were 5 to 10 carts sitting in the lot unused.  The manager of the rental program was kind, but seemed to have her hands tied by a policy that required her to hold carts for people who may or may not arrive.  I was standing there with money in hand offering to return the cart if it was needed. The lack of a cart led us to leave the island more often resulting in us spending our vacation dollars outside of the resort.  Think about it!!    The food at Rum Bay was less than acceptable regardless of the high price.   My kids don't complain much about the quality of food, but even McDonald's wont serve french fries that cold and stale.   My guess is that the staff was trying to do their best, but policy and work load may have been the root cause of some poor decisions.  The staff was always very kind and friendly.  Everyone had a smile.  Red beard was a hit as usual.    In the future we will avoid spring break and stick with the off season.   I hope these comments are helpful and not taken as overly critical.

Reviewer Comments: We traveled with 3 Senior citizens ( 1 handicapped), and three teenagers. The development and the unit were very clean and in a good location( overlooking the lake). There is not much to do in the immediate area, but in a 1/2 hour you can be in St. Augustine or Daytona.  The unit we stayed in(1123) was very well maintained and the kitchen was well equipt. When renting this unit for 8 people, take into consideration that the dining table is only large enough for 6 people, ( with 2 folding chairs) and there are 2 barstools at the counter- (not conducive to a family sit down dinner.) Also,the patio could have used more seating. Couches were uncomfortable for the Senior citizens so they spent their time in the dining room chairs. I also think for the price we paid, the unit/development should have beach chairs and umbrellas on site. We had to spend another $140 to rent chairs and an umbrella, as we flew in from out of state.  Internet service was spotty at best. Also, beach is not Handicap accessible, ( at least not in the Condo area). Other than these issues, the unit it very spacious and the setting is beautiful. Beach and Pool were very nice. Would have been nice to use the game room at night to keep the teens occupied.     JT's Restuarant and Flagler Fish Company had some great seafood!!!

Reviewer Comments: This cabin was in a good location and had a good view. When we first walked into the cabin i went strait for the fire place to turn it on. As soon as i pushed the power button sparks started flying and smoke was coming out. This is a gas powered fireplace so that does not seem to safe. Called maintenance and they didn't come look at it until the night before we left. It still was not fixed. The ceiling fan was extremely covered in dust and it was really moldy looking behind the fridge. The blinds on the door going to the back deck was tore to pieces and fell apart when u try to raise them, A lot of the dishes had food crust still on them. The propane grill on the back deck was really nasty and had to be completely cleaned before we could use it. A lot of the doors would not shut and would just swing open when u try to close them. There was so much to complain about on this cabin. Ive been to several sugar maple cabins and they were amazing. I paid over $300 a night and these people cant even maintain the place or respond to maintenance issues on time.

In paying $900 to stay for 4 nights, we expected to be able to at least get a good nights rest, but that was actually the opposite of what happened. Everyone woke up with sore backs and necks. I went to talk to the property manager and they were of no help. Also, the power was out at our house for 4+ hours one night making it so that we couldn't cook and had to spend $90 on average pizza. I talked to management about that as well and nothing was done. A free night, a voucher, or reimbursement for dinner would have all been fair options but again, nothing was done. I've had pleasant stays in SR before through this company, but this spring break didn't turn out that way.

They had a magnificent time playing on the beach, body surfing in the ocean, and swimming in the pool.  They would rotate around these activities all day.  Beachfront properties, such as this, are great this way -- you don't have to commit to going and staying on the beach all day -- because you're so close, you can take advantage of the beach whenever you want.  It was also very nice being located so near to Coligny Plaza, a nearby fun shopping and dining plaza area (within bike riding distance of the house).

The sound of the ocean all day and all night long, the beautiful evening light, the charming grounds, cooking our own dinner and eating on our beachfront deck: as far as we are concerned this is exactly the way we want to experience Hawaii rather than being in a big hotel, and it is not easy to find.

It was clean and comfortable, though a little dated.  It isn't fancy so you don't feel like your staying at your Gramma's: you're staying at a condo by the beach, you can relax!    This top-floor unit has a nice sunset view.  It does not face S Kehei Street directly which made for quiet nights.  It has AC, but multiple ceiling fans and an open lanai were all we needed for a blissful tropical night's sleep.     At the owners request, we were very attentive about taking the garbage out daily.  My wife and kids are sensitive to 'bugs' and Dorli's instructions about bugs and garbage and tropical areas insured that ample attention would be paid to keeping things clean.  I wish we had more bugs around Seattle seeing the effect it had on my kids and their keeping things picked up!  Never saw a bug all week.     The location of the unit is excellent.  Many amenities are easily walkable from here.  Charley Young beach (1 blk) is an excellent family beach.  Kamaole Beaches (4 blks) are very nice and shops and restaurants in the area are plentiful.  We took surf lessons down the street at the Surf Shack (4 blks).  Robert was great with us and the kids.        We ate at the 808 Bistro one night, at Lulu's another.  Kid's favorite was Maui Taco (more Hawai'ian than Mexican, so it's better than you'd think).  We did the Te Au Moana luau at the Wailea Marriott, arranged by the concierage service.  A luau for 4 is a little spendy, but a good show, good food and a knockout setting.  Compare it to taking the family to a full-on dinner theater show with free drinks and it's not really out of line.  It is a uniquely Hawai'ian experience and it was something to which we wanted to treat ourselves.  If you've never done a luau, go for it!    We are snorkel novices.  Snorkeling at beaches around condo is certainly doable but our best rec's are Mile Marker 14 area (roadside park) on the way to Lahaina, nice, shallow easy entry into the water.  Black Rock in Kaanapali was outstanding. Pay for valet parking at the K-Beach or Sheraton hotels and walk down (curbside load/unload, totally worth it).

The location was by far the best feature here.  It was great to be able to see the mountains by stepping on the patio or looking out the window.  The prairie dogs are right there in the park in the \"backyard\".   A playground is right there as well.  A new Wal-Mart is about 2 miles away but not visible and its a modern low impact facility.  The neighborhood is very new, clean and quiet.   C470 is 2 miles away which provided us easy access to Denver but especially the Mountains.   We were only 20 minutes from Lookout Mountain and about 15 minutes from I-70.  Downtown is about 20 minutes away.   This location is on the far west part of Littleton.  Its on the outskirts and not as developed as the rest of Denver. (C470 and Bowles).  The amenities were great.  Clean, comfortable (my back issues were not a problem).  The owners thought of the kids, providing DVDs, toys, books and even a stuff animal.   The bedding was average, for a really cold night you may want to crank up the heat.  Though they did have a down filled comforter in the closet that I did not discover until we were leaving. The towels and washclothes were plentiful and of good quality.  The furnishings were basic but very nice.  Plenty of drawer space.  Loved the sofas.   This technically is a 2bdrm plus office\\den with a pull-out sofa.  So there is sleeping for six.  Not sure the bedding would be sufficient during very cold winter nights....   The fireplace is nice and warmed up the place nicely.  The internet was fast though we had a problem with the wireless and had to use hardwire.  The cable T.V. was robust and had a lot of options.   The fridge was a little noisy at times as was the heat but for temporary housing it was okay.   And I may be a little noise sensitive.    Overall we give it 4 out of 5.

Everything was fine until 2 DAYS before our vacation on 3/30 when CEL called and said we no longer have a place to stay. Shocked I asked what they were going to do since we were flying out in 2 days. Their answer \"Sorry, that is not our problem\". The first reason they gave us was that a pipe broke and they needed to fix it. (This was false). Then they finally told me that the reason was because they thought we were a bunch on college guys and we were going to trash the place. (also false). We finally found out that they doubled booked the house and let the guests that paid more get it. So basically they knew what was going on and just wanted to earn interest on our money.   After getting nowhere with them I finally asked for my money back so I could start looking at other houses and hotel rooms. They told me I would have my money back in 2 WEEKS.

The property is in okay shape but does need some minor fixing up.  The main item that bothered us the most is the wall/painting directly behind the bed is rotted out, thus allowing anyone to enter the house and not providing much comfort when trying to sleep.  The biggest problem that we the whole time is with the manager/Bali owner.  We would clearly make an agreement for an excursion with a certain company four days before and then the night before at 9 PM he would say they are full!  Of course he offered then to book the excursion at another company he knew at a special price....  Or we would make an agreement of a price for a drive and then afterwards he would change the price.  For example he drove us to the beach and we set an arranged pickup time since he had to run some errands.  When he picked us up, he claimed to have waited for us the whole time and wanted to be paid for the full time.  The best was when I got home to Europe, I had some purchased stone statues which he was to organize the shipping.  Once in Europe he changed the price and added extra taxes / charges for no reason.  Hint - go with the shipping company of where you buy the item.  In the end we could not handle him anymore, so his younger brother drove us around for a few days.  Needless to say it ruined our vacation.  If you decided to stay here do understand there is not really anyone near that speaks english, which is all fine, but you have no other driver choice you can walk to.

At the end of our most recent visit, we spent hours cleaning the home, mopping, vacuuming, sweeping, dusting, everything that was required on the rental agreement.  It was CLEAN!  We were surprised when we recently received our security deposit as it was not returned in full.  Infact, she kept $100, indicating the house was \"not clean enough for the next guest\".

I stayed at this house with a group of responsible friends. We had a great time aside from a bad fall someone took due to the icy conditions down by the hot tub. We cleaned the house top to bottom and had everything exactly where it was when we walked in. Unfortunately after the weekend ended we were not given our security deposit back. The person who organized the weekend got a rude email from the lady who rented us the house, Sandie. She said we were in violation of the contract and that she took pictures of all the cigarettes that were left outside. She said that the hot tub lid was not secured even though we had tried calling to let them know that the straps to the hot tub were broken when we got there. According to PA law she was required to send us an itemized list of our damages totaling the cost of the security deposit, which she also refused to do. She also would not send us the \"so called\" pictures she took of our damages. We felt as though this was a scam. We had a lawyer contact her and she responded by saying that she would only communicate with the person whose name was on the lease. That person contacted her several more times requesting an itemized list of damages and pictures to see if what she was claiming was true. She would not send either one. We decided that hiring a lawyer would cost more money than to take the loss of the security deposit, but we felt as though we were 100% taken advantage of.

The Jacuzzi did not work, and when we finally got a hold of Tania, she informed us that it had just broke a couple days before we arrived, however we found out later that it had been broken for months.  Prior to our arrival, we had asked specifically if everything on the estate was in working condition, and were told that indeed it was.  This was an obvious lie by Tania…and for the rest of our stay, we were unable to use the Jacuzzi as the water did not heat up.  My husband asked Tania to have the owner call us back, which she promised to do….but never did!  Additionally, 3 months after we came back home….our $1000 deposit still had not been returned to us.  It was only after we repeatedly called Tania, did we finally receive the check……a full 4 months after we vacated the property.  The contract stated it would be returned within 30 days after our departure.        While Tania promised us an additional refund of $100 for the broken Jacuzzi (a rather paltry sum we might add!)….to this day, a full 7 months after we departed the property, it has still not been refunded to us (excuse after excuse why she has not sent it yet).  Repeated attempts to reach Tania have been futile; she has not returned even one of our many calls!  On the rare occasions that we did speak to her about our $1000 deposit, there was always some excuse as to why we had not received our money.  The Estate itself was very beautiful….but our experience with Tania left a very bitter taste, and we certainly will never return to that property again!  We have traveled all around the world, and this was by far the worst experience we have ever had with a manager.  The only highlight was Kiri, the caretaker, he was an absolute doll….and did everything he could to make our stay comfortable!  We highly recommend he be promoted to be the Manager of the estate, he would be certain to do a much better job than Tania.      My recommendation if you do choose to stay here, is to make absolute sure everything is in working order before you arrive.  And if Tania is still the manager expect to be on your own.

We would highly reccomend this property to anyone interested in maintaining privacy while having access to a multitude of amenities and  interesting places to visit. The property was very clean and well maintained. The house was right on the river, providing excellent fishing opportunities as well as boating access. The wildlife was abundant with bald eagals, hawks, deer, wild turkeys, geese, ducks, racoons, squirrels and several bird species that frequented the property. The house had all the comforts of home with a magnificant view of the river and hills while nestled in the woods with a private and serene setting. It had a huge floor to ceiling fireplace in the great room surrounded by large windows that provided picturesque views from three sides. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen came fully equiped. We spent a week here and wished we never had to leave. We visited both Diamond and Crater Lakes on day trips and were amazed by the beauty of these alpine aquifers. We hiked several magnificant water falls which are all within a short distance from the property and afforded well maitanied trails and parking. We mostly cooked at home but did eat out in both Glyde and Roseburg and were pleasantly surprised at the fine quality and choices we encountered. Wine tasting at several wineries in the area was a high point, as we were not familiar with the many great wines cultivated in this region and we ended up subscribing to a couple of our favorite wineries. The many covered bridges in the area was another exciting surprise  that reflected a by gone era and offered great photo opportunities.  On our last day, we picked Blackberries in the back yard, caught a 3 pound Trout and fed peanuts to the bluejays and squerrils, much to their glee.

It was so quiet that I could hear the crows wings beating as they flew by.

The house is generally as advertised. The items I take exception with are as follows:  The \"large screen TV\" is a standard television, not flat panel and is really not that large compared to TVs today. Takes multiple controls to make it function.  The dining room does have large windows but as we were visiting during the summer we had to keep the blinds closed because it was to bright/sunny and hot  The kitchen is well equiped but with old, worn out appliances and cheap tableware. The pots and pans are worn out and there is a shortage of mixing bowls. The toaster really needs to be replaced.  Calling the yard a \"forest\" is an exageration.  There are two kayaks as advertised but the green one leaks badly (i.e., don't take it out into deep water for very long). There was only one life jacket so both can't be used safely at the same time.  The place does have a \"beach\" but it is shared with the people from next door. The pictures make the place seen quite isolated but it is close to two other houses on either side.  The place is locked like a fortress. It takes three locks to get in the front door which is almost impossible to do before the alarm goes off. The oother door on the main level is gated with multiple locks so hopefully you won't have to get out of the place fast due to a fire since they all require keys from the inside in order to get out.  Only one window has a screen (and it has holes) so you can't open the house up at night in the summer without letting in a swarm of insects.  The Internet acted up for us the entire time. Some of the cabling needs to be replaced and you have to be patient to get a connection. It's DSL.  The place is advertised with Off-street parking but you really need a four-wheel drive vehicle to get up and down the steep driveway without losing traction. The drive has obviously had problems in the past and their is severe erosion. The gate at the entry needs to be closed when coming and going and that requires someone to get out of the car on the hill.  I would not call the BBQ and authentic outdoor parrilla. It's a grill top over a campfire spot on the ground.  There is a system that pressurizes the water and it leaks in such a way that the noisy pump runs every 20 seconds for about 10 seconds or so even when the water is turned off. There is a switch to turn off the pump.

The beach is fantastic and all of the condos in this development are \"ocean front\" by any other other resort's standards.  The pool is nice and sheltered if the beach gets too windy.  The status of units varies based upon the individual owner, and it is not possible to generalize by block A, B, C, or D.  We rented three condos in block D for us and extended family.  This unit was most worn (by far) of the three we rented and the most expensive!  Bathrooms are in desperate need of renovation (note lack of pictures).  What was most disappointing was the condition of the linens -- very worn and stained.  I cannot explain the other positive reviews.  Furnishings and kitchen were average.  The owner makes a big deal of how she is \"on island\" and thus maintains the place.  We found the opposite is true.  The people who own and furnish their units as their vacation dream exhibit much higher pride of ownership.  This is simply a rental unit.  Finally, the owners only pay for the maid service once during a weekly stay so beware when comparing with other units.

It appeared from the write-up that it included a balcony—however, it most definitely does not! Thus, I felt the write-up on it was inaccurate since it specially mentions a balcony and that is why we rented it!!!!!—the only balcony is outside in the hallway leading up to the apartment.  As for the fantastic views promised in the reviews and write-up—we had a side view of the ocean and beach from several windows rather than any kind of straight-on view, so the view was also disappointing and not what we expected—you have to go out of the way to see the ocean. Also, it claimed to have wireless—but instead had a cable connection for the internet (which we had to turn on and figure out and without even a desk there to sit at) and the very small tv in the bedroom area had a green line down the middle. Otherwise, the place was clean and as advertised (albeit quite small); however, the kitchen chairs were uncomfortable, the director chairs scary to sit in, the trashcan in the kitchen was broken, several pans were dirty and/or broken, and the bed, which was comfortable, seemed more like a slightly larger double than a queen size bed. Also when I tried to use my hair dryer in the bathroom it blew the fuses--and we had to dig thru a lot of storage items to get to the fuse box to flip the switch and then I had to use a plug in the living room from then on.

If there were a washer and dryer, I didn't see them.  They might have been in the garage, which we didn't use.

You wouldn't want to stay here if you had small children who need to bathe rather than shower, or if you want to eat in and have more than four people.  Our major problem, though, was that this house smelled awful.  It was like a combination of Raid and cigarette smoke.  The first night we had to open every window and door for several hours just to make it bearable.  The smell got better over the three days but was still there when we left.  It was difficult for my asthmatic daughter.  I suspect that a previous tenant had smoked in the house and then someone had tried to cover it up with some sort of chemical.

She was very helpful, but our son lives in Kona up the hill so we went to his place for the night.  It was reassuring to know that she was there with Plan B for us & was willing to do whatever we needed so that we were comfortable. This unit is very comfortable. The mattress & the bed linens are like a 5 star hotel & were so comfortable. The unit is very clean & if there are any issues you contact Sheila & it is taken care of immediately. The kitchen is equiped with the basics for simple cooking. I do a lot of cooking for my son & his friends when I am on the Big Island & thought the pots & pans could be upgraded. However I keep a storage box at my sons with things I have purchased over time that I prefer in the kitchen so I just move that to where ever I am staying, so it wasn't terrible.

My family has rented many vacation homes in the past 7 years or so & never paid any damages. We've come across some very lovely homes & some that are just ok. That's expected when traveling away from home. This property is slightly above average, most everything on site are as advertised. The location is absolutely beautiful! We, my husband, myself & our 17 & 12 yr. old sons, practically had the place to ourselves over spring break 2011. I communicated with the owner through e-mail  prior to our arrival & everything was very amicable on both sides. Upon our arrival we were impressed with our choice with just one exception, it smelled of dog. The owner, however, stated that no dog had been in the place. Through past experience with a property we owned, we found the only way to eliminate pet odor entirely was to remove the carpet completely. This was not an issue with us, we simply opened a window to air it out & I bought febreeze to spray on the carpet & furniture. Everything went well through the week & upon our departure we did all that was necessary of us. We stripped the beds & put all the linens in the master bath, separated & took the trash out to the curb. Two days after we returned home, I received an e-mail from the owner that 1 pillow case & a fitted sheet were missing. This baffled me since I'd already unpacked & done our laundry from the trip & of coarse we didn't have it. In fact, we had such a long drive home that we all packed our bags the last night there except for the clothes we were wearing to save time in the morning. I felt bad that things were missing & told the owner our departure procedure. After 12 days of not hearing from her, I e-mailed again to see if the items had shown up. To my utter surprise the e-mail I received back listed 10 more additional things that were keeping us from receiving our deposit back. BEWARE of  everything, inspect all things (even those things you may not use or think about) upon arrival at this property because we lost our deposit for things that  fell under simple maintenance & already existed .

We spent much time researching our lodging on St John. We settled here based on the photos, price & location and friendly correspondece with Russ. We liked being outside Coral Bay & near Lameshur beach. Russ explained the photos were taken by the prior owner in 2009, but they do represent the unit; which I would describe as a simple camp with lovely furnishings, but a rough structure. What the pictures don’t show is the wear & tear on the screens & the warped doors. The problem is that one screen had a large hole in it and all the doors have gaps around the edges which allowed an infestation of bugs and other critters to enter the camp while we tried to sleep. Our first night, we tossed, turned and swatted biting bugs all night long. When we complained in the morning Russ put a mosquito net over the couch/bed and sprayed. This was a nice gesture, but they still got to us. The netting didn’t go all the way to the floor so was no protection plus laid across our faces while we tried to sleep. The couch/bed is the only place to sit in the living room and it was impossible to sit under the net comfortably. The 2nd night there was a larger rodent that gnawed away at a plastic pepper shaker all night and knocked items off shelves. I am perplexed as to why we seem to be the only people that have had this problem, perhaps it had been particularly rainy prior to our arrival. Regardless, it is reasonable to expect accommodations to be built to keep out bugs and vermin. After 2 nights of barely sleeping and waking up itchy with bites all over, we sadly made the decision to salvage the remaining 5 nights of our stay on St John and spent the morning securing alternate accommodations. We expected Russ would gladly refund the unused portion of our stay, but he said he felt no obligation to do so. Since we didn’t purchase the VRBO insurance and paid by check we have no recourse but to go through small claims court. Our suggestion is to pay for your accommodations through PayPal (giving you credit card protection) and take out the VRBO insurance. Also ensure that Russ has repaired all the screens and replaced the doors to ensure a proper seal to keep out the bugs and vermin.
